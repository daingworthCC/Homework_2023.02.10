5026541 # Every day approximately 43 families in the United States receive the news that their child has cancer( National Cancer Institute NCI, 2017). This translates to more than 40,000 children receiving treatment for cancer each year. Unfortunately, an estimated 20% of children diagnosed with cancer will eventually die of the disease( Wasilewski-Masker et al., 2014). Cancer remains the number one cause of death by disease in children( NCI, 2017). Although the incidence of pediatric cancer has been rising each year by an estimated 1% to 2%( Terracini, 2011), the outlook for childhood cancer has improved from 50% survival in 1975 to 80% in 2010( NCI, 2017). Therefore, there are more children living with this disease than ever before. # When a child is diagnosed with cancer, it causes a crisis for all aspects of family life and trauma for all members of the family( Al-Gamal &amp; Long, 2010 ; Ozono et al., 2010 ; Peek &amp; Melnyk, 2010). An initial diagnosis of cancer can cause families intense feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, &amp; von Essen, 2013 ; Rosenberg et al., 2013). Hung, Wu, and Yeh( 2004) reported that these severe feelings of stress were often higher in parents of children with cancer than in parents of children with cancer-related or non-cancer-related disabilities. Bennett, English, Rennoldson, and Starza Smith( 2013) reported that all the parents of children with cancer in their study showed significant distress, and more than half showed levels of stress for which professional consultation is recommended. The range of issues faced by parents of children with cancer is vast, and if these issues are not properly addressed, they could create a lifetime of dysfunction for parents and their families( Kostak &amp; Avci, 2013). In addition, it is well documented in children 's cancer research( Melnyk et al, 2004 ; Streisand, Braniecki, Tercyak, &amp; Kazak, 2001) that parental stress has a negative impact on the parents ' level of compliance with treatment and on the diagnosed child 's emotional well-being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assist parent populations in decreasing their psychological stress would be beneficial not only to the parents but to their child as well. # According to Cernvall et al.( 2013), there is little research dedicated to counseling parents who have children being treated for cancer. Most research examining the emotional and psychological effects of children 's diagnoses on parents originates from the fields of oncology( Fayed, Klassen, Dix, Klaassen, &amp; Sung, 2011 ; Kostak &amp; Avci, 2013 ; Tsimicalis et al., 2012 ; Vrijmoet-Wiersma et al., 2008) and nursing( Bayat, Erdem, &amp; Kuzucu, 2008 ; Peek &amp; Melnyk, 2010), without synthesis and translation to counselors. As part of the child 's inpatient treatment, parents are typically assigned several staff members( e.g., counselors, neuropsychologists, pastoral staff, life management coaches, social workers) who offer counseling services to both parents and children in the form of parent support groups, family counseling, and individual counseling. Therefore, information on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is needed and lacking. # This article describes mental health issues common to parents of children who have been diagnosed with cancer. By understanding pertinent issues parents face, counselors will be better able to address this population 's unique needs. Discussed below are therapeutic considerations for parents of children with cancer :( a) the initial diagnostic period ;( b) the child 's prognosis ;( c) the parents ' therapeutic needs in relation to the age of their child ;( d) short-term consequences of treatment, including the increased care needs of the child ;( e) long-term consequences of treatment ; and( f) additional psychological stressors, including insurance complications. # THERAPEUTIC CONSIDERATIONS # Initial Diagnosis # For the parents of a child newly diagnosed with cancer, the initial diagnostic phase is the inauguration of a long period of distress and coping for the family. In addition to the shock and emotional stress associated with the enormity of the diagnosis, parents often confront an overwhelming amount of information that they must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avci, 2013). Given the nature of the disease, it is imperative that families make decisions about their child 's treatment and treatment facility almost immediately upon learning about their child 's diagnosis. # As there are a limited number of treatment facilities qualified to treat pediatric cancer, families are often faced with the revelation that they will need to relocate for months or years to pursue treatment for their child. Furthermore, parents frequently report difficulty not only with emotional coping and life planning, but with acquiring and understanding all the information needed and made available to them at the time of their child 's diagnosis( Grootenhuis &amp; Last, 1997). Therefore, while attempting to manage the shock and fear of the initial diagnosis, parents are also required to make overwhelmingly important decisions about their child 's care during a traumatic time in their lives. # During this time, counselors can not only empathetically address the grief, shock, and trauma parents are experiencing from the initial diagnosis, but also address the gravity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents with support and resources to aid them in their decisions. Evidenceased strategies that focus on stress reduction and trauma management( e.g., acceptance and commitment therapy ACT, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy MBCT, and mindfulness-based stress reduction MBSR), in addition to empathetic listening( Rogers, 1979), might be most helpful at this phase in a parent 's counseling. These strategies( i.e., ACT, MBCT, MBSR) can help parents allow uncomfortable thoughts and feelings about their child 's illness to arise without assigning a value judgment to these thoughts or emotions( Hayes, 2004). Counselors can give parents the tools to accept their thoughts and feelings, rather than denying or fighting them. This will assist parents in connecting with the present moment, freeing them to make important decisions for their child( Ruiz, 2012). # Child 's Prognosis # A survival statistic is an individualized calculation that consists of a percentage and time period that estimates the likelihood cancer treatment will be successful( e.g., a 50% chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Liu et al., 2017). In determining a child 's survival statistic, medical professionals must take into account the pediatric cancer type( e.g., leukemia, brain cancer, lymphoma, kidney tumors, neuroblastoma), subtype( e.g., one of more than 100 different types of brain tumors), location or locations( e.g., spine, heart, lungs, liver), and stage( I through IV ; NCI, 2017). The combination of these four factors, along with other considerations, can lead to a wide array of prognoses( e.g., from a 99.9% survival rate over 10 years to a 0% survival rate with a few weeks to live). Each prognosis comes with its own distinct, empirically based recommendations for treatment. # When providing therapeutic services to the parents of a child with cancer, it is also important for counselors to consider each parent 's perception of their child 's cancer prognosis. This understanding can provide counselors with key information that could assist them in determining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Fayed et al.( 2011), parents ' prediction of their child 's chance of survival is the most important factor in determining how they feel about their child 's treatment. Furthermore, having an accurate depiction of parents ' current level of psychological distress can aid counselors in choosing appropriate intervention strategies to meet each parent 's individual psychological needs. However, parents ' prediction of the child 's prognosis does not always align with the projection from the child 's oncologist( Fayed et al., 2011). Therefore, it is important for counselors to accurately assess both the oncologist 's appraisal of the child 's prognosis( the survival statistic) and parents ' interpretation of the child 's likelihood for survival, given that there could be contradiction between the two. # A counselor 's ability to assess a discrepancy between oncologists ' predictions of a child 's chances of survival and the parents ' assessments could lead to a better understanding of each parent within the couple. For example, a contradiction between the parents ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i.e., if one marital partner is optimistic about their child 's chances and the other is pessimistic), and vacillations in mood from hope to despair, or despair to hope, as the parent moves from their own optimism or pessimism back to the figure given to them by the oncologist. # Counselors could use these in-depth insights into the complex psychological functioning of this population to assist parents. Specifically, parents often experience ambivalence, outside of their own awareness, about their child 's chances of survival. For example, a parent with a child who was given a 40% chance of living might sometimes think, " My child is going to suffer through treatment only to die a horrible death, " thereby feeling helpless, hopeless, and depressed. At other times, this same parent might think, " My child will have to suffer through treatment, but their suffering will come to an end and they will get to live, " thereby likely feeling hopeful. Counselors could first attempt to raise parents ' awareness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child 's chances of survival influence their emotions( Hayes, 2004). Then counselors could assist parents in understanding the connection between their ambivalent thoughts and feelings. Finally, counselors could teach parents to detach from unwelcome thoughts and feelings, thereby assisting parents in coping with feelings of depression or anxiety associated with their child 's illness. # Age of the Child # The developmental age and capability of the child diagnosed with cancer present their own unique set of characteristics. Although there does not seem to be a correlation between child 's age at diagnosis and parental distress( Santos, Crespo, Canavarro, Alderfer, &amp; Kazak, 2016), it is important for an empathetic counselor to understand the developmental issues that are unique to parents with children from varying age groups. This section discusses some of the differing challenges associated with various age groups of children with cancer. # Infants and other noncommunicative children. Parents of infants, or of other children who are incapable of caring for themselves or communicating, report a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty with( a) managing emesis and mouth and gastrointestinal tract sores( mucositis) during and after chemotherapy to ensure the child does not choke ;( b) changing diapers without being exposed to the toxic chemicals inherent in the child 's waste after chemotherapy ;( c) maintaining their infant or child 's central line or gastrointestinal tube ;( d) dealing with feeding issues, as infants often refuse sustenance after harsh chemotherapy treatments and therefore are at risk of starvation and dehydration ;( e) preventing their infant from becoming exposed to airborne germs, given that protective face masks are not designed for infants ;( f) administering medications ;( g) helping the child meet developmental milestones while in treatment ; and( h) understanding whether and where something is hurting the child, given the communication barrier( Edelstein, Schippke, Sheffe, &amp; Kingsnorth, 2017). # Toddlers. Parents of toddlers face similar issues. However, with this population, the child has increased ability to communicate and understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added challenge for parents. The ability to speak and understand can be a relief to parents, because the child may be able to communicate what hurts and where, making some aspects of treatment easier( e.g., managing nausea/vomiting and pain). However, additional issues parents report with this age group include stress related to difficulty( a) obtaining blood draws ;( b) administering chemotherapy ;( c) preventing children from harming themselves from pulling or chewing on intravenous cords ;( d) getting the child to wear a mask to minimize exposure to airborne germs ;( e) preventing oral and tactile germ exposure, given this age group 's limited understanding and their need for tactile and oral exploration of their environment ; and( f) dealing with the child 's overall increased fear of and lack of cooperation with treatment( Katz &amp; And, 1980). # Older children. As children age and communication improves, some of the issues presented above can improve. However, some children experience such acute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply checking the child 's temperature or administering medication can be a daily struggle, causing further stress not only to the child but also to the parents( Katz &amp; And, 1980). In addition, as children become more aware of their condition, they begin to fear not only pain but death as well. The children 's cancer research literature( Bayat et al., 2008 ; Fayed et al., 2011 ; Tsimicalis et al., 2012) reports parents often feel guilt, despair, and depression when their children begin to fear death. In addition, parents can have difficulty managing their child 's emotions, inquiries, and assumptions related to death( Kostak &amp; Avci, 2013). # Adolescents. A parent with a child who has a cancer diagnosis during adolescence will often endure some of the same difficulties obtaining cooperation with treatment, along with the existential anxieties mentioned above. However, academic, social, and self-esteem issues can also arise. Although some of these issues can arise at almost any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with comforting and supporting their adolescent child with issues related to( a) not being able to see friends or significant others,( b) losing their hair,( c) postponing or keeping up with their academics, and( d) missing or delaying key life events( e.g., attending prom, obtaining a driver 's license, or attending graduation or college ; Cho &amp; Park, 2015). In studies exploring adolescents ' perceptions of their diagnoses, members of this age group often discussed feeling frustration, resentment, and lack of control( Lombardo, Popim, &amp; Suman, 2011 ; Wu, Chin, Haase, &amp; Chen, 2009). These studies also discovered a correlation between adolescents ' feeling of frustration about their diagnosis and noncompliance with treatment. Pelcovitz et al.( 1998) reported that, although adolescents who were diagnosed with cancer were particularly vulnerable to the traumatic effects the life-threatening illness presented, they were also at a cognitive and emotional advantage when compared with younger children. Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer diagnosis, it is important to consider their child 's age, as it shapes the key concerns central to parents. # Given that parents of infants and toddlers are more likely to be concerned about coping with issues related to their child 's care, to parent-child attachment, or to helping their child meet developmental milestones, counselors may want to incorporate strategies from developmental counseling( Piaget, 1937) or attachment theory( Bowlby, 1969) into their counseling with this population. However, when working with parents of older children, trained counselors might want to explore the existential themes of death, freedom, isolation, and meaninglessness( Yalom, 1980) with their clients. Through exploring their values and ideals surrounding these themes, parents would ideally become more comfortable and self-aware. Thus, parents would be better equipped to cope with and discuss the concerns that are common with older children( i.e., meaning, fear of death, lost relationships). # Adherence to treatment is an area of concern for parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however, is vastly different between age groups. The therapeutic strategies counselors use to help parents increase their child 's adherence to treatment should match the child 's developmental age. Whereas nonverbal strategies such as filial therapy( Bratton, Landreth, Kellam, &amp; Blackard, 2006) or behavioral strategies( Zemp, Milek, Cummings, Cina, &amp; Bodenmann, 2016) may work better for assisting parents with toddlers or small children, talk therapy strategies such as Adlerian therapy( McVitte &amp; Best, 2009) or motivational interviewing( Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2002) might be more appropriate empirically based tactics for parents of older children and adolescents. # Short-Term Consequences of Treatment # Although the short-term consequences for each parent population vary according to the child 's treatment regimen, this section addresses some of the diverse short-term issues parents may encounter across a range of treatments. # One challenge to parents of children undergoing cancer treatment is the risk of infection. Whether their child 's treatment protocol involves radiation, chemotherapy, or surgery, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposure to bacteria and viruses that could, depending on the phase of treatment and illness contracted, potentially( a) postpone treatment,( b) cause a life-threatening infection, or( c) lead to serious illness or in some severe cases death( Styczynski et al., 2016). Thus, the potential repercussions of exposure to even minor illnesses( like the common cold) in some cases and phases of the child 's treatment could be dire. # Parents are often instructed to take the strictest precautions during a period of time called nadir( the time period when their child has no immune system with which to fight infection ; Hyo Sook et al., 2007). This time period often occurs after the child has received certain chemotherapy drugs. Parents are asked to isolate their child from others and limit their own exposure to germs, given the risk of spreading these germs to their child. During these time periods, some parents choose to wear masks to protect themselves( thereby protecting their children) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community( i.e., to the grocery store, pharmacy, doctor 's office, or counseling center). These periods of isolation can also lead to loneliness and amplify parents ' anxiety and depression( Adams et al., 2016). Thus, this population 's added need to protect their children from infection can further add to their emotional unrest. If a counselor or staff member is or has been sick, these ill individuals should immediately take precautions( i.e., the ill person should refrain from touching the clients and should wear a mask as a form of reverse protection), and counselors should make their client(s) aware of their own or their staff 's illness before they come for counseling. # In addition to the risk of germ exposure, parents of children receiving radiation or certain chemotherapy drugs need to be vigilant about a whole host of symptoms( e.g., seizures, tremors, fevers, rashes that indicate low platelet counts, changes in mood ; Gharzai et al., 2016 ; Kung, Zhang, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et al., 2013). This means parents might be particularly anxious during certain periods in their child 's treatment. Thus, counselors can recognize and even predict these times of additional strain by staying abreast of the child 's medical treatment plan and assist parents in identifying, expressing, and normalizing emotions during these taxing intervals. # It is important for counselors to understand that parents, in addition to being isolated for periods of time from friends, distant family, and the general public, are often isolated from their immediate family( i.e., their other children and spouse or partner ; Edwards &amp; Clarke, 2004). Parents and primary caregivers frequently report that they stay overnight in the hospital with their child whenever possible( McCann, 2008). However, in most hospitals, " well children " are not allowed to stay in the hospital room after visiting hours, and with some forms of cancer treatment( e.g., stem cell rescue chemotherapy), children are not allowed to visit at all. Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least one parent has to work and care for the other children in the home, leading to a temporary separation that can span weeks or months at a time and cause strain on marital and parent -- child relationships( Edwards &amp; Clarke, 2004). # Adding to the magnitude of the isolation and of managing the emotional consequences of their child 's diagnosis, parents also report stress and encumbrance related to overseeing the increasingly complex medical needs of their child( Edelstein et al., 2017). For example, children often require a host of medications to manage the side effects of chemotherapy, and these medications can be difficult and time-consuming to administer. Parents are required to quickly learn each of the medications required, along with the methods for administering each medicine. Parents may also have to provide daily care for a central venous catheter, gastronomy feeding tube, nasogastric tube, or implanted port. In addition, parents often have to meet their child 's changing nutritional needs. This can mean learning how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strictly monitoring their child 's daily caloric intake. Furthermore, as previously mentioned, managing germ exposure is a common issue with which parents must contend. Thus, in addition to isolation, parents must make sure they frequently wash their child 's hands, body, clothing, and bedding. With the increased care needs of the child, parents report enduring a great deal of added psychological distress that often falls in the clinical range( Grootenhuis &amp; Last, 1997 ; Young, Dixon-Woods, &amp; Heney, 2002). # While managing feelings of isolation, parents also often feel they have to maintain a degree of emotional composure when caring for their child. Parents commonly report the need to " stay strong " for their child. Thus, simply having a nonjudgmental, empathetic, safe place for parents to process their fears, stresses, and challenges could be therapeutically beneficial to parents. This safe place( i.e., the counselor 's office) could not only provide parents with relief from isolation but also give them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for coping with caregiving, and attend to their own needs, so that they can find the strength to care for their child. # Although family or couples therapy might not be possible given the reasons cited above, counselors might spend time normalizing and exploring any feelings of abandonment, isolation, and loss the caregiver feels for their children and spouse. Specific therapeutic recommendations for creating dailycouples or parent-sibling time via video conferencing or phone calls may also be provided to decrease feelings of isolation( on the part of both caregiver and family member) and encourage relational bonding. # Long-Term Consequences of Treatment # A variety of factors impact the potential and assured long-term consequences of cancer treatment, and parents often must weigh the risks and benefits of each type of treatment to make expeditious decisions about their child 's care. For example, parents are frequently asked to decide whether or not( a) to give their child 's neurosurgeon permission to cut away live or necessary brain tissue that has been invaded by a tumor ;( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child is not of the age recommended for radiation ;( c) to proceed with chemotherapy ;( d) to decrease the recommended dose of chemotherapy drugs in order to inhibit secondary long-term side effects ; or( e) to terminate or forego treatment altogether( Imbach, Kiihne, &amp; Arceci, 2006). These decisions, along with the weight of their consequences, can have an enormous effect on parents ' mental health( Edwards &amp; Clarke, 2004). Thus, it is important for counselors to understand that these decisions might be weighing on parents before attempting to provide them with counseling. # Other long-term consequences of treatment that might weigh on parents ' minds include the effects of the chemotherapy drugs their child has to take. There are several different chemotherapy drugs, each with their own method of administration( e.g., intravenous, topical, oral, injection), implications for use with specific types/subtypes/grades of cancer, and side effects( Imbach et al., 2006). Some treatment regimens call for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a few, and some do not necessitate chemotherapy at all( Sloper, 2000). Some chemotherapy drugs can cause irreversible hearing loss and kidney damage, and others can cause irreversible sterility( Wasilewski-ker et al, 2014). Some additional long-term effects of chemotherapy and other common treatments for cancer( e.g., radiation, stem cell transplant, and surgery) on children include emotional and behavioral problems, decreased IQ, organ failure or complications( e.g., heart, lung, liver), paralysis, loss of limb(s), permanent loss of consciousness, scars, and secondary cancers. Thus, parents may be struggling with accepting the long-term consequences that the treatment itself will have on their child, and counselors can help parents confront and normalize their fears. # Parents ' concerns can be debilitating, and being faced with a choice that may influence whether their child lives or dies can be traumatic. After spending time processing parents ' feelings about the long-term consequences of their child 's treatment, counselors may want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and accepting the painful thoughts and feelings associated with the real and potential consequences of their decisions about their child 's treatment. ACT( Ruiz, 2012) can be beneficial in teaching parents to detach from their worries and memories, allowing them to make informed choices about their child 's treatment without feeling crippling emotional pain. A process in ACT, cognitive defusion( Hayes, 2004), helps individuals understand that thoughts are just thoughts, without minimizing the very real circumstances behind them. # For example, a parent might struggle with whether to decrease the dose of chemotherapy because their child is suffering long-term, permanent hearing loss. The parent might think, " If I decrease the chemotherapy dose and my child dies of cancer, I will regret the decision and feel responsible for their death. On the other hand, if I keep the dose the same and my child can not hear for the rest of their life, I will feel responsible for their hearing loss. " A clinician, trained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how thoughts such as these are impacting their feelings( e.g., guilt, discomfort, pain) and then assist them in defusing/detaching from the maladaptive feelings. Thus, strategies associated with ACT may be helpful in assisting parents with coping with the long-term consequences of cancer treatment on their child 's health and emotional well-being. # Additional Psychological Consequences and Stressors # Counselors also need to be alert to additional common emotional consequences for the parents of children with cancer. Several psychological consequences and stressors are well documented in the research literature( Bayat et al., 2008 ; Baykan, Bayan, &amp; Nacar, 2010 ; Elcigil &amp; Conk, 2010 ; Hung et al., 2004 ; Kostak &amp; Avci, 2013 ; Lansky, Cairns, Hassanein, Wehr, &amp; Lowman, 1978 ; Sloper, 2000 ; Tsimicalis et al., 2012). These consequences include depression( Bayat et al., 2008 ; Kostak &amp; Avci, 2013), posttraumatic stress( Kazak, 2005), sadness( Sloper, 2000), anxiety( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2013), marital discord( Lansky et al., 1978), financial costs( Santos et al., 2016 ; Tsimicalis et al., 2012), sibling issues( Johnson, 1997), diminished social relationships( Elcigil &amp; Conk, 2010), mental disorders( Kostak &amp; Avci, 2013), stress levels( Hung et al., 2004), and decreased life satisfaction( Baykan et al., 2010). # Although not well documented in the research literature, insurance complications can add to parents ' list of severe psychological stressors( Edelstein et al., 2017). It is common for insurance to deny children access to very highpriced treatments, even when they are common practice and an accepted, empirically based part of their treatment regimen. Although medical staff can appeal these decisions, and insurance companies typically end up approving the treatments in the end, this process can take days, weeks, or months, allowing time for the child 's cancer to regroup, grow, and spread. Unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood cancer can proliferate at alarming speeds, in some cases doubling in size every 8 to 12 hours( Ossola, 2017). Thus, as parents understand the enormous costs these postponements or rejections may have on their child 's chances of survival, they may feel hopeless, helpless, and angry when insurance companies delay or deny their child access to much-needed treatment. # Counselors should be aware of the psychological problems experienced by parents, thoroughly assess parents within each of the domains of functioning listed above, and provide this population with strategies to cope with these common issues. Some of the ways counselors can help parents cope include normalizing and preparing them for the potential setbacks in each of the domains above. Specifically, counselors can prepare parents by structuring in vivo experiences( Hayes, 2004), thereby making them aware of these potential difficulties before they arise. Counselors could assist parents in identifying and differentiating between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors associated within each of the domains above. This awareness, along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may ease parents ' shock and disturbance. # DISCUSSION # For the parent of a child with cancer, life abruptly becomes chaotic and distressing. Caring for a child who has cancer predisposes parents to a multitude of psychological stressors. Parents ' psychological distress is often compounded by( a) the need to make difficult expedited decisions about their child 's care ;( b) their perceptions of their child 's prognosis ;( c) the unique developmental demands of their child ;( d) their concern over the short- and long-term consequences of their child 's treatment ;( e) the need to meet the increased care needs of their child ;( f) their own feelings of sadness, anxiety, stress, and depression ;( g) the financial costs ;( h) the difficulty maintaining harmony within their relationships ; and( i) the insurance-aggravated delays in treatment. # Parents can greatly benefit from counseling. Using the knowledge gained from understanding parents ' unique situations, the well-trained counselor can provide support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents by a counselor can facilitate emotional coping and can help ease a family through these long periods of crisis. Counselors who are equipped with the knowledge of what parents might be experiencing as their child is in treatment can tailor their therapeutic strategies to meet their client 's needs. Specifically, whereas parents who have children in the early diagnostic stages of treatment may need strategies that are designed to assist clients in more effectively managing their emotions( e.g., MBSR, ACT), parents who are in the midst of treatment and are feeling isolated, afraid, and alone may benefit from having a safe place to process their thoughts and feelings in a nonjudgmental environment. However, counselors must be thoroughly trained in the use of therapeutic practices and techniques before employing them with clients. In addition, the therapeutic strategies mentioned in this article are not exhaustive and are meant to serve as suggestions, rather than directives. There are several methods of counseling that would be equally effective with this client population. However, this article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be effective with the parents of children with cancer. # Research on counseling parents of children with cancer is lacking. The purposes of this article are to fill gaps in the research literature, begin a muchneeded discourse on this important topic, inform practitioners about some of the experiences parents may go through, and provide suggestions for assisting parents at various stages of their child 's treatment. However, additional research is needed to assess the use of empirically based treatments with parents of children who have cancer. # REFERENCES # Adams, R., Mosher, C., Abonour, R., Robertson, M., Champion, V., &amp; Kroenke, K.( 2016).
