4009541 Section : Speaking Out <p> An issue that will continue to confront educators in the 1990s involves reshaping the curriculum to meet the interests and abilities of students as they move through this new decade. Examining this issue thoroughly can not but force educators to reevaluate their thinking about schools and schooling. Although I am not suggesting a revolutionary restructuring of education, I am proposing a change that may be revolutionary in any given school. Indeed, this change may make a difference in the dropout rate and the literacy level of any school population. The fact is that when students are in class, they are working with a curriculum that is simply outdated. <p> We need to change how we view our curriculum. I was interested in an article by Sam Crowell in Educational Leadership( 1989). He suggests that we move from a point of view of fragmentation to one of integration as we seek curriculum change. We must see the school as less of a place to study parts of a curriculum and more of a place to interact with specific subject matter as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world. We must make major connections between content and process. We can no longer view these as separate topics. Our schools " have separate subjects, separate skills, separate objectives, separate evaluations, segmented continuums, linear methods, behavioral techniques, and isolated classrooms. Moreover, these practices convey to students a world of knowledge unrelated to meaning and a world in which outcome is independent of process "( 61). <p> What do we do? There must be more cooperation in and among departments. Students must cooperate and collaborate with each other to solve problems found in and outside the classrooms and must draw on knowledge and processes that can come from social studies, science, English, and the rest of the traditional curriculum. The hue and cry of many folks in and out of education is that schools must teach students to think -- critically and creatively. My concern is that we give students nothing of substance to think about. Robert Sternberg( 1985) offers a similar view : " Solving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequential problems of life "( 198). We are still feeding our secondary students pablum when they ought to have graduated to meat and potatoes! Through this integration paradigm, the isolated elements of the school begin to disappear, and in their place surface more interdisciplinary teaching and learning. When this happens, relationships among and across disciplines increase, and knowledge and the processes by which that knowledge is attained have stronger and more direct meaning for students. They begin to see their education as much more relevant and meaningful. Now, I take the " quantum leap " and suggest that, as a result of this change, students will have more of an interest and a need to stay in school to learn the critical skills for survival. The following areas deserve attention. The Teaching of Writing <p> We have made great strides in the teaching of writing in schools. We must continue with this effort. Research is very clear when it relates writing and thinking. If young people are to face the challenges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking must be emphasized in our classrooms. Writing provides the vehicle for that thinking to take place. Through prewriting, revision, and even the act of writing itself, students are called upon to relate, connect, predict, associate, analyze, synthesize, and evaluate. By using the writing sequence, students sharpen their ability to think. <p> In the future, English/language arts teachers will need to do even better if this writing emphasis is going to make a difference. They must break away from the hold that grammar teaching has on them. Again, the research clearly and emphatically states that there is no relationship between the isolated teaching of grammar and the ability to write effectively. The 1986 report of the National Assessment of Writing states that, even with the emphasis on writing since the mid-seventies, " most students, majority and minority alike, are unable to write adequately except in response to the simplest of tasks "( Applebee, Langer, and Mullis 1986, 9). I believe we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than just add on the writing emphasis. We must change the curriculum by removing the isolated drills in grammar study and include the study of language structure as students write and read. I am appalled when I see in schools( mostly middle and junior high) the time wasted trying to identify nouns, verbs, and other parts of speech from dummy sentences found in the grammar book. Weeks go by without writing. If we do n't follow the research and make these changes, we will continue to read the same results in the 1996 and 2006 national assessment reports. <p> **29;0;TOOLONG programs also hold considerable promise. Again, if we pursue my goal -- the integration of skills within and among disciplines -- writing in the content classes can add much to the learning process. Lynn Steen( 1989) has written that " there is no better way to learn mathematics than by working in groups, by teaching mathematics to one another, by arguing about strategies, and by expressing arguments carefully in written form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example, before having students read about a concept, teachers can find out what students already know about the subject by having them write for a short time. I 've seen a teacher introduce the concept of acid rain to students in an interdisciplinary study of the environment. Before introducing the material, students wrote about what they knew ; they then shared that with a partner, wrote again, and then shared again. By the time the teacher gave the students the material to read, they were already aware of many of the characteristics of acid rain. Their motivation to learn more about the subject was heightened tremendously. Writing to learn/writing across the curriculum offers much for the schools of the future. The English teacher and other content teachers must integrate writing first into the content currently found in the curriculum and then into newly created interdisciplinary units. The Teaching of Literature <p> We must continue to foster a positive attitude toward literature, so that students will read voluntarily rather than regard reading as a task to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to abstract models of correction to teaching writing by having students use their own voices, we need to continue to move away from the emphasis on literary criticism to the emphasis on the literature itself and the students ' response to it. We 've accomplished a great deal with this shift of teaching methodology. <p> Our challenge for the period ahead lies, therefore, in the area of content. One of the greatest assets the English teacher and other content teachers have is the young adult novel. Widely used as supplemental reading, the young adult novel unfortunately has yet to nudge the more standard, traditional( sometimes classical) literature from the curriculum. This traditional literature -- I call it " safe " literature -- offers no controversy -- no conflict with peers or parents, no conflict with the community, and, too often, no substance that the student feels is worth reading about. We do not need to remove all classics from the curriculum, but I am suggesting that there are many students in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These works offer very little that students find rewarding or that convinces the students that reading is worth the effort it takes. <p> The contemporary young adult novel, besides being good literature in itself, can serve purposes that no heavy adult classic can. It can give to students works of literature that they will find satisfying and exciting. It can also challenge their ideas about life and its meaning, but on terms that they can understand and accept. Equally important, these novels provide literature that most students can read successful day understand with reasonable ease, and talk about with other students. If we are interested in using literature to teach thinking skills to make connection with universal themes, to respond to important ideas, and to experience good writing, we must provide them with material that they can get excited about reading. really good young adult novels like Bette Green 's Summer of My German Soldier, Sue Ellen Bridgers ' All Together Now, Larry Bogard 's The Kolokol Papers, Richard Peck 's Are You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gentlehands, and Fran Arrick 's Chernowitz consider the same serious problems of humanity as the classics do, but they explore these issues in a way that young students find rewarding and meaningful. <p> Again, research in this area should give us pause. It is evident that the majority of adults do not read. When asked a question about their reading habits, most adults indicate they have read no books in the last year. Educators ought to ask why. Does it relate at all to the kind of literature program we offer our students? Are we providing a curriculum that ultimately stops many adults from reading? <p> I think the young adult novel may be very useful in another way. As transitional literature, the young adult novel may help the younger student move from the concern-for-oneself stage of reading appreciation to the aesthetic, creative stage of reading development. Used in this way, young adult literature serves as a bridge between childhood reading and the more mature reading of the high school junior or senior. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elementary grades directly to the classics. If the classics are to be used at all they should be left to the more sophisticated reader, the type of student usually found on the upper high school level. <p> Now, how might the young adult novel be used outside the English class? Whether the curriculum emphasizes the specific traditional disciplines or is comprised of multidisciplinary units, young adult novels and short stories can be incorporated either as supplemental reading or as regular classroom reading. A few examples will suffice : Madeline L. Engle 's and Jean Craughead George 's works may be used by the science teacher ; books by John Tunis, James Summers, Robert Lipsyte, and Chris Crutcher may be useful to the physical education teacher ; the social studies teacher would want to consider James and Christopher Collier 's The Bloody Country and My Brother Sam Is Dead, Bette Green 's Summer of My German Soldier, Anne Frank 's The Diary of a Young Girl, Sue Ellen Bridgers ' Notes for Another Life, M. E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thunder Hear My Cry. Interdisciplinary Learning <p> There are strong forces that may inhibit quick changes in curriculum design. Most teachers at the middle and secondary level like the security of their content area within the single classroom. Also, with the clamor for accountability, most will not venture forth with something that does not fit or emphasize a traditional base curriculum. I believe this thinking must change. While these traditional methods may have worked in the past, and may in the present, although I doubt it, they certainly will not be effective in the future. As learning how to live in our constantly changing world becomes a primary survival skill, our present school curriculum -- teacher centered, fact oriented, textbook dominated, and presented in isolated periods of time with no connections among the various subject areas -- is not a realistic curriculum for the future. We must make a change. <p> I was impressed with a conference in which I participated m Boulder, Colorado( 13-16June 1989). The Interdisciplinary Learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought together educators from across the disciplines and from across the country to interact with each other about learning and teaching among disciplines. I was pleasantly surprised by the willingness of those that I met to integrate content in a multidisciplinary approach. Sure, there were the sceptics, but most of the people at the conference were either already doing some of it or were ready to go back to their schools to give it a try. While l accept that most people attending the conference were, perhaps, members of a unique group -- already committed to change -- it was exciting to hear what they saw as their mission when they returned to their districts. <p> Perhaps the challenge for English/language arts teachers is to take the initiative and leadership role with this curriculum change. Many of these teachers have been involved in similar curriculum arrangements for some time now. Elementary teachers for the most part are working with the whole-language approach, which certainly is an integrated curriculum within the language arts area but also across the other disciplines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thematic unit as the curriculum design. Teachers choose literature, language, writing, and oral activities around a central social or linguistic theme. This concept could easily be enlarged to include the content and skills found in social studies, math, science, foreign language, and other disciplines. Why not arrange the high school curriculum or a portion of it around a theme that would be of interest to students and still meet the academic responsibilities of the content field?? Investigations that center on the environment for example, certainly could involve all disciplines. A course called " American customs " would involve everyone, too. Students could explore communication, social, political, and religious customs. Although every lesson might not meet the interest of every student, it seems to me that we have a better chance of success if we move in this direction. Students at risk might be caught up in this theme as they compared their contemporary customs -- dress, travel, communication -- with the customs of the past. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the systems -- social, political, mathematical, religious, biological, physical, communication -- that the nation( or the world) follows? To tie the subject matter of the world to the school must be one of our new goals in education. <p> There have been a few well-known programs that follow this interdisciplinary approach. The Foxfire program in Georgia comes to mind, as does Project Wild and Project Learning Tree in Colorado and the innovations in the Fremont County School District in Wyoming. There are many others : some in which the whole school is involved ; others, on a much smaller scale, in which two departments join to create a unit. <p> Well, what will happen as we move through the 1990s? I believe it can be a successful time in education if we follow what we have learned from research and experience : provide for a meaningful learning experience. Add to that the concept that the student is the center of the learning process, and we will have a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @
