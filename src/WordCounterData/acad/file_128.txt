Melissa Sonnen <p> Color Slide Division PSA Conference Programs <p> Mary Ellen Brucker, FPSA, Conference Program Director for the Color Slide Division( CSD), reports that four outstanding programs offering a variety of photographic how-to subjects are lined up for the 2004 PSA Conference in Minneapolis. <p> M. Craig Carver, FPSA, of Portland, OR will present Photography at Home, a new program detailing many ideas for photo projects one can do without leaving the house. The program draws on Carver 's well-known creativity in abstract, close-up, glass, and other subjects ; and provides clear instructions for photographers at all skill levels. <p> One of PSA 's most successful portrait photographers, Liz Keery, APSA, of Somers, CT will show how she works her magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characterized by dramatic color, flawless lighting, and dating composition( e.g., she has successfully shot her subjects in horizontal formats). <p> Light, a key element in most images, is the subject of two other CSD programs. Alan Millward, FPSA of England will present Different Light for Different Subjects. This program features landscapes, many from the UK, along with people and some nature subjects. <p> Ambient Light is the subject Mike Rudman, APSA, will cover in his presentation, his second in two years. Attendees will remember his very popular program on landscape photography last year in Houston. Nature PREFORMATTED TABLE Digital Nature Exhibitions <p> The feasibility of conducting a digital Nature exhibition, where acceptances could be credited towards a Nature star rating, is being discussed in the Nature Division. At present, only prints or slides are allowed in Nature exhibitions. <p> Photographs for this type of salon would be submitted and judged according to the technical rules of the EID, but adhere to the traditional definition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the photograph with all the wonderful tools on the computer would NOT BE AN OPTION. Rules governing these nature salons will be discussed and proposed by the Nature Division for the Consolidated Exhibition Standards during the coming year. Limitations on Nature Section Entries <p> The Consolidated Exhibition Standards state that an entrant may only enter a maximum of two sections of a PSA-recognized nature exhibition and use these acceptances for credit in Star Ratings and Who 's Who. Currently an exhibition may run general nature and wildlife sections in both slides and prints, but only two of these may be used for credit. It is the responsibility of the exhibition Chairman to include a statement to that effect on the entry form and to only judge entries for two sections for each individual. Marilyn Cloran <p> Pictorial Print PREFORMATTED TABLE Five-Star Awards <p> Star ratings are not usually reported in the PPD column. However, this time it is warranted because it is a milestone for a relatively new print category. Small Monochrome Prints has been gaining popularity and has a contributor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach the five-star award. She also joins a very small number of people who have attained the five-star category in Small Color Prints. Green Eagle Awards <p> We have an unusual occurrence this month.

To be eligible an image must be an original photographic image taken by the maker. After that it can be modified or manipulated in an image-editing software program as long as it contains at least 50% photographic content when completed. <p> A picture of another 's artwork or creation does not qualify as a photographic image. Further, it raises questions of copyright violation in some cases. Conversion of such images to 3D is interesting and to be commended, but this does not qualify the image for a photographic exhibition. However, any recognized exhibition has the option to sponsor a non-recognized section for non-photographic images, as Cascade has done.

It serves the counties of Alpine, Amador, Butte, Calaveras, Colusa, El Dorado, Glenn, Lassen, Modoc, Mono, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Shasta, Sierra, Siskiyou, Stanislaus, Sutter, Tehama, Tuolumne, Yolo and Yubu in northern California and Churchill, Douglas, Iyon, Ormsby, Storey and Washoe in northwest Nevada. <p> As one of the most successful Chapters, in the early 1980s they sponsored the Reno-Sparks PSA Regional Conference. Inspired by the enthusiastic response, in 1988 the Chapter joined forces with the Yerba Buena Chapter to co-sponsor the Annual Asilomar Conference. In June of 1993, the Chapter again sponsored and hosted another successful PSA Regional Convention in Sacramento, CA. <p> To promote photography among the youth, the Chapter participates in the Annual PSA Youth Showcase.

The teacher, as well as other students, attended the event. <p> The success of the Chapter is attributed to its experienced and dedicated program chairmen who secure the most talented presenters and arrange for a variety of subjects and " how to " programs for each quarterly event. In addition, attendees are invited to bring their photographic works for display and review. This creates an excellent opportunity to exchange stimulating ideas and techniques among attendees. The Gold Rush Nugget Bulletin keeps the membership informed and it is presently edited by Diana Valusek. The Chairman is Truman Holtzclaw, V. Chairman is Jim Cunningham, Secretary is Jean R. Harris, APSA and Treasurer is Samuel G. Shaw, APSA. Society Presidents, many division chairmen and numerous project chairmen came from the Gold Rush Chapter.

Camera Club PREFORMATTED TABLE Bulletin Editors : <p> How-to articles by fellow club members are popular inclusions in many camera club newsletters. The authors usually are long-time club members and experienced photographers who have valuable and interesting information to often. Often, however, their how-to writing is wordy, hard to read and hard to understand. <p> As newsletter editor, you must spend time with a red pencil to edit copy and clarify the writing for your readers. Copy editing does not mean that you should rewrite the whole article. Copy editing just polishes the author 's writing to make it easier to read. <p> Here are a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edit submissions : <p> -- Delete repetitive words and phrases. <p> -- Replace weak verbs with strong verbs to eliminate the need for adverbs. <p> -- Read the material aloud. You 'll be surprised how much wordy material you can eliminate once you read it aloud. <p> -- Replace fancy words with plain words, unfamiliar words with familiar words. <p> -- Choose " picture " nouns and " action " verbs rather than adjectives and adverbs. <p> -- Avoid long words when short ones will do as well. <p> -- Prefer simple, declarative sentences to complicated sentences. <p> -- Vary sentence lengths. <p> -- Use active voice. <p> -- Put statements in positive form. <p> -- Remove needless words, sentences and paragraphs. <p> -- Copy edit carefully. Improvement is always possible.
