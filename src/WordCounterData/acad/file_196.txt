4088741 In May 1919 a number of British and American historians found themselves in Paris, in and around the foreign ministry at the Quai d'Orsay, with long stretches of time on their hands. Harold Temperley and James Butler from Cambridge, Alfred Zimmern and Arnold Toynbee from Oxford, Charles Webster from Liverpool and their counterparts from Harvard or Columbia had been recruited by their governments to advise on shaping the post-First World War world. In the vast and complex peace conference, they concerned themselves with disputed frontiers, the future of ethnic minorities and distant colonies and the Covenant, or rule book, of the emerging League of Nations. </p> While they waited for British Prime Minister David Lloyd George and US President Woodrow Wilson to conclude the critical deals, the historians and an influential group of British and American delegates met at the Hotel Majestic, where the British delegation was staying. The meeting resolved to establish an Anglo-American institute of international affairs to promote public understanding of global problems and thus, it was hoped, contribute to a more peaceful world. </p> The initiative created the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also known as Chatham House following its move in 1925 to the former home of the Earl of Chatham in St James 's Square, London. This year the institute celebrates its 90th birthday. </p> Chatham House is known as a meeting place for foreign policy specialists, with discussions held under the ' Chatham House Rule ' : that journalists and others may use things they hear there, but must not reveal where or by whom they were said. Less well known is the fact that, from its foundation, Chatham House also devoted some of its resources to promoting the writing of contemporary history with a policy-related purpose.( The institute is financed by members ' subscriptions, donations and research grants.) </p> At the meeting of 1919, those present had decided to produce a major and unprecedented work of contemporary history. This was to become a six-volume history of the peace conference in which the delegates were still engaged ; just as they hoped the conference would bring a peaceful and stable new world, they also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace settlement would help the League of Nations and its member-governments to ensure continued peace and cooperation. </p> The work which appeared between 1920 and 1924 as A History of the Peace Conference of Paris, containing contributions by 50 authors and amounting to well over a million words, was planned at speed during that Paris summer of 1919. The editor was Harold Temperley, who had been an editor of the Cambridge Modern History. As he argued in the foreword to the first volume, it was essential that the contributors should have first-hand knowledge of their respective topics : </p> Articles written at the time by persons present at the Conference, or with an intimate knowledge of the events they describe, must reproduce much of the spirit and atmosphere in which the Conference met. Most of the authors were American or British, but they were urged to ' regard the Conference not from Washington or from London, but from Geneva, where for the first time in world history a permanent world organisation will be established '. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maintain the peace settlement was underlined by the editorial decision that ' the text of the treaties and other documents that may be required for future reference should be appended '. </p> One difficulty relating to source material had to be overcome in a historical account which was meant to be ' authoritative but not official '. Most of the contributors were to write about issues they had handled officially, but their governments forbade them to quote documentary material they knew directly from their official duties. There were ways around this. On the Versailles Treaty 's provisions for reparations, for instance, fully documented details of the negotiations were published in polemical exchanges between two famous participants, the British economist and Treasury adviser John Maynard Keynes and the US statesman John Foster Dulles, which made this important material available for the History. Looking back after his task was completed, Temperley was able to claim : ' I edited an authoritative history - which did reveal some diplomatic secrets ' It also offered an account -useful to future negotiators - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more successful than others. </p> From the first meeting, the assumption had been that the account of the peace conference would be the first instalment of an annual series of ' registers ' of world affairs, each volume recording the events of the preceding year. In July 1920, at the inaugural meeting of the British Institute of International Affairs, the policy-related case for this ongoing coverage of contemporary history was put by Earl Grey of Falloden( formerly, as Sir Edward Grey, the British foreign secretary). An annual survey, he said, ' will not interfere with policy, but provide materials from which politicians, statesmen and journalists can form sound opinions in regard to policy '. </p> The new institute 's founding members included a number of historians who agreed with Grey that it should promote the writing of contemporary history. The original discussions in Paris had crucially linked the idea of creating an institute with that of writing history. As well as the historians already mentioned, those involved included London University 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sumner and C.A. Macartney, the former Edinburgh professor George Prothero, the Cambridge historian Kenneth Pickthorn( later to be a Conservative MP and minister) and the arch-Zionist Lewis Namier. In its early years the institute was housed in rooms in Bloomsbury belonging to London University 's Institute of Historical Research. </p> But who was actually to write the sequence of annual histories? Fortunately, Arnold Toynbee was available. For 30 years Chatham House 's Survey of International Affairs was either written, edited, or inspired by him, as the institute 's Director of Studies. Toynbee( 1889-1975), who before 1914 had taught ancient history as a Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford, had become involved in contemporary affairs during his wartime and postwar service in the Foreign Office 's Political Intelligence Department. He took up the task of writing history for the institute in 1924. He produced first two volumes bridging the gap between the peace conference and the end of the year 1923 and then published, annually up to the eve of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Press, Chatham House 's publisher, brought out in the year after the one each described. </p> Toynbee was able to keep up this considerable output( and produce each volume in less than 12 months) by developing techniques much more more familiar today than they were in the 1920s, when the idea of writing contemporary history was new. He scrutinised the texts of international agreements, governmental statements and other public documents ; he made great use of interviews with both British and foreign decision-makers( including, in 1936, Adolf Hitler) ; and he commissioned sections of many of the Survey volumes - for instance on economic trends or particular regions - from outside experts. </p> Toynbee also consulted extensively ; he maintained close contact with the Foreign Office 's historical adviser, Sir James Headlam-Morley, and some sections of the Survey were read in draft by Foreign Office officials. Another adviser was the diplomatic historian Charles Webster, who had moved from his chair in history at the University of Liverpool to promote the fledgling academic discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Woodrow Wilson Professor of International Politics at Aberystwyth, teaching and writing about the League of Nations and continuing to work with Chatham House. During and after the Second World War, Webster - by now at the London School of Economics - worked on the Charter of the United Nations Organisation and then co-authored the official history of the strategic bombing of Germany. </p> Perhaps Toynbee 's biggest contribution to the methodology of contemporary history was his systematic and meticulous use of the international press as a documentary source. Chatham House 's press library, an invaluable resource for later historians, originated with the small team of specialist assistants who scanned, clipped and cross-indexed articles from the world 's leading newspapers for the use of the polyglot Toynbee and his co-authors. </p> The Survey( and its accompanying volumes of Documents on World Affairs) provided a comprehensive and, on the whole, reliable account of recent events. At a time when fewer books on contemporary issues were published than is the case today, Toynbee 's output was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1930s, when the threat of war began to loom large, Toynbee 's uninhibited criticism of world leaders ' actions became controversial ; his denunciation of the British and French foreign ministers, Samuel Hoare and Pierre Laval, for appeasing Mussolini as he overran Ethiopia in 1935 was disputed by many. In particular, it was ridiculed by another eminent member of Chatham House, E.H. Carr, a former career diplomat who in 1936 became a successor to Webster as the Wilson Professor in Aberystwyth. In his scintillating analysis of recent history, The Twenty Years ' Crisis( 1939), Carr wrote that for Toynbee to accuse Britain and France of ' negative, weak-willed, cowardly egotism '( Toynbee 's words) was moralistic and unhistorical and that Toynbee 's view of Britain 's position was ' compounded of platitude and falsehood in about equal parts '. But such criticism, like Elie Kedourie 's onslaught on Toynbee 's coverage of the Middle East in The Chatham House Version, published in 1970, was relatively rare. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious criticism by undertaking a vastly more ambitious project than the Survey of International Affairs. He was by now spending part of each year, after completing work on the annual Survey, in composing a gigantic study which claimed to interpret the entire course of human history. Its central theme was the rise and fall of humanity 's 21 historic ' civilisations '( the proper unit of study for historians, he argued), which could be clearly identified and systematically compared. The first three large volumes of A Study of History appeared in 1934, another three in 1939 and the concluding four in 1954. Toynbee 's work encouraged historians to look beyond their Anglophone or Eurocentric horizons towards what was later called ' world history ', but his grandiose scheme attracted criticism both in its detail and in its overall interpretation of the nature and destiny of ' civilisations ' and is now taken more seriously by sociologists than by historians. </p> The Second World War naturally interrupted both Toynbee 's writing and the other activities of Chatham House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Foreign Office 's new Research Department, of which Toynbee was the director until 1946. He then spent nearly another decade at Chatham House completing A Study of History, directing a series of extended Survey volumes covering the war years and supervising the writing of new annual volumes on the prewar model by younger authors. The most productive of these was the wartime codebreaker, historian and publisher Peter Calvocoressi( 1912-2010), who produced five volumes in five years covering the late 1940s and early 1950s. After the departure of Toynbee and Calvocoressi, the last editors and authors of the Survey were successively Geoffrey Barraclough and Donald Cameron Watt, the latter of whom produced the volumes on the years 1961 to 1963. </p> The decision taken by the institute in the 1970s to close down the Survey was due to financial constraints( and to a priority given to more directly policy-related studies), rather than to any lack of interest in contemporary history. The members of the institute 's Research Committee at the time included the historians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House continued to produce a number of historical works. Although by now these shared the market with comparable publications from the numerous international studies or contemporary history centres in the university world, the fact remained that, historically, Chatham House had been the principal pioneer of this field of research. </p> Chatham House 's mission of helping policy-makers to heed the insights of history and thus avoid repeating the mistakes of yesterday has been taken up by a number of enterprising historians in the History and Policy group( www.historyandpolicy.org). Founded in 2002, the group, which seeks to explain the relevance of history to contemporary policy making, is a collaboration between Cambridge University, London University 's Institute of Historical Research and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The question of whether the History and Policy group, in tandem with Chatham House, is achieving its somewhat elusive aims is a matter for future debate. </p> For more articles on this subject visit **35;614;TOOLONG </p> The original discussions in Paris had crucially linked the Idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( BLACK &; WHITE) : A gathering of the study group for the Committee on( postwar) Reconstruction in the Common Room at Chatham House, c.1940. </p> PHOTO( BLACK &; WHITE) : Arnold Toynbee in his office at Chatham House during the late 1940s. </p> By Roger Morgan </p> Roger Morgan has taught at the University of Sussex and the European University Institute, Florence.
