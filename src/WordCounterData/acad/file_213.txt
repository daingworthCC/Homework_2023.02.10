4156041 Background # Leaders of an urban school district organized more than 200 schools into smaller professional learning communities( PLCs) so that teams of reading teachers could collaborate for the purposes of learning, joint lesson planning, and problem-solving. The purpose of the study was to determine if urban students ' reading achievement increased as a result of weekly collaboration among teachers in a large, urban school district in Texas. Repeated measures ANOVA results and pair-wise comparisons from quantitative findings revealed that statistically significant growth rates( p&lt;.05) occurred after PLCs were established. Qualitative data showed that teachers perceived PLCs as impacting their classroom practices and students ' achievement. Sixteen categories and two subcategories provided support for four broad themes that emerged from teachers ' responses to focus-group interview questions. The current investigation represents the reading portion of a larger study that analyzed students ' reading and math data over a S-year period for increases after initiating PLCs as the primary professional-development strategy for teachers, principals, and other educators. # From the inception of Why Johnny Ca n't Read( Flesch, 1955) to the No Child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and national levels have given great attention to the most effective ways to develop quality educators. This national attention on teacher training, curriculum, and instruction is outlined in detail with each revision of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965( ESEA). An urban school district in Texas borrowed the notion of Professional Learning Communities( PLCs) from the business sector and facilitated this professional development strategy with more than 200 schools. # In Texas and across the nation, significant achievement gaps continued to exist between different student groups. Illustrations of such variations between subgroups were evident in the spring 2010 Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills( TAKS) reading data. Students who met standard included 81.2% of African Americans ; 84.8% of Hispanics ; 93.6% of Whites ; 83.1% of Economically Disadvantaged students ; 49.9% of Special Education Students ; 68.5% of Limited English Proficient( LEP) students ; and 74.9% of At-Risk students. As a result of consistent collaboration among teachers, students ' reading achievement increased across the district. # Literature Review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases in organizational change or student achievement data after consistent facilitation of PLCs. Consideration of professional collaboration began with Follett( 1924), whose interest in the human-relations movement in business led to self-governing ways of relating in the workplace. Since Follett 's time, the ideas of relating and professional collaboration in the workplace have burgeoned into the development of PLCs in school districts as an alternative to the one-shot staff development approach. This augmentation was largely due to growing evidence that when teachers consistently collaborate and problem-solve, student achievement is enhanced( NSDC, 2001). # In 1969, Chin and Benne investigated different strategies to impact teacher change and concluded that the normative-reeducative model was most effective with influencing change in teachers ' classroom practices. With the normative-reeducative model, teachers viewed change as a natural process because they were directly involved in decision-making. Chin and Benne reported that, through collaboration over a period of time, teachers were empowered with problem-solving techniques. # In the 1970s and 1980s, attention to collaboration continued to flourish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformational leadership supported Follett 's( 1924) work on relating in the workplace to further develop the notion of PLCs. PLCs were undergirded by a human and participatory philosophy that manifested through collaboration in the workplace regarding organizational improvement. Knowles( 1979) advocated that a traditional assumption regarding adult learning--that a person was fully equipped to practice a profession upon completion of formal professional training-proved ineffective. According to Knowles, the rapidly changing technology and communal or shared situations caused a person 's skill level to depreciate unless he or she engaged in a lifelong program of professional development. For instance, an individual who fluently used a typewriter in the 1970s probably required ongoing professional development in the workplace in order to operate a computer and word-processing program in the 21st century. Knowles ' assumption contradicted the one-shot workshop model for professional development and increased support for job-embedded collaboration and learning. # Little( 1982) conducted an ethnographic study that involved three high-performing and three low-performing schools in an urban school district for a 19-week period and concluded that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high- and low-performing schools represented in the study. Sparks( 1983) extended Chin and Benne 's theory( 1969) that one-shot presentations did not allow for gradual change, which entails opportunities for regular discussions of problems related to the implementation of new learning. DuFour and Eaker( 1998) advocated that one of the most promising strategies for sustained, substantive school improvement was developing the ability of teachers and principals to function as PLCs. After completing a correlational study involving 46 secondary teachers, Guskey( 1985, 1986) proposed the following alternative professional development model :( a) change is gradual and challenging ;( b) teachers need regular feedback on student achievement ; and( c) teachers require ongoing support and follow-up after the first training. # Findings from studies conducted in the 1990s augmented support for PLCs. McQuarrie and Wood( 1991) outlined misunderstandings regarding classroom practice that were discussed by teachers during weekly PLCs. For instance, teachers rarely made connections to instructional issues in their classrooms by attending one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff development approach did not align with research and theory that underpinned teacher change( Chin &amp; Benne, 1969 ; Sparks, 1983 ; Guskey, 1985). McQuarrie and Wood concluded that change, specifically in classroom practices, is accomplished in phases over time. # Similarly, Hoban, Hastings, Luccarda, and Lloyd( 1997) found that participation in weekly PLCs among high-school science teachers enhanced both the teachers ' and students ' learning. In their analysis, Hoban et al. summarized an innovative 3-year professional development program, called Enhanced Action Learning, that used PLCs. During PLC meetings and collaborative sessions, teachers collectively focused on science content and how to address science skills at each grade level. As the establishment of PLCs strengthened collaboration among these teams of high-school science teachers, major changes occurred in their classroom practices that ultimately positively impacted students ' learning. # By the 21st century, school districts across the country continued to replace the one-shot workshop model for teacher development with organized PLCs. An illustration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Linek, Fleener, Fazio, Raine, and KleKamp 's findings in 2003. Collaboration between university professors and a public school district resulted in improved student achievement at three of the lowest-performing elementary schools. Once more, findings supported continuous collaboration as pivotal to shifting the education focus from how teachers teach to how children learn. Castle, Arends, and Rockwood( 2008) collected student achievement data over a 6-year period from two low-performing elementary schools with similar demographics. Students at the elementary school where teachers participated in weekly PLCs showed a 35% increase in fourth- and fifth-grade reading scores. Mokhtari, Thoma, and Edwards( 2009) described reflections from two reading specialists and a principal who served students at an elementary school in the midwestern region of the United States. Students showed improvements across all grade levels after the principal established PLCs and collaborated alongside teachers. Fischer and Hamer( 2010) facilitated professional development at a middle school over a 5-year period. As a result of consistent professional learning, state-mandated-testing results improved in mathematics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The current study added credence to Chin and Benne 's( 1969) findings that changes in classroom practice occur when teachers participate in the change process. According to Hord( 2009), the mission of a school is student learning, and the most important variable in whether students achieve is teaching quality. PLCs provide a vehicle for teachers to problem solve and improve their teaching. # Method # This study followed a causal-comparative research design and utilized mixed methods. According to Patten( 2009), a causal-comparative research design allows researchers to examine the past for causes of a current circumstance when it is not possible to carry out an experiment. A combination of purposeful and stratified sampling was employed for selection of the 76 participating schools and 35 teacher interviewees. Because this study represented the reading portion of a larger study, 17 of the 35 teachers taught reading or language arts. These types of samplings allowed the principal investigator to select participants from low-, medium-, and high-performing schools for exploration. # The primary investigator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationships that may have accounted for variations in student achievement. The TAKS was the instrument used to collect quantitative data for reading over a 5-year period. A repeated measures ANOVA was used to analyze overall percentage passing within elementary, middle, and high school groups. Within-group variances and contrasts determined if scores changed significantly during district-wide implementation of PLCs. The significance level was set at.05. # The qualitative portion of the study consisted of nine audio-taped focus-group interviews ; each focus group was comprised of three or four teachers. Responses from focus-group interviews provided support for four broad themes :( a) collaborative teacher learning ;( b) data-driven decisions ;( c) curriculum, instruction, and student learning ; and( d) school culture. # Findings # The study explored two research questions :( a) What differences existed in the overall percentage passing in reading achievement data for elementary, middle, and high schools during district-wide implementation of PLCs? and( b) What were teachers ' perceptions of PLC activities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question was that several statistically significant improvements occurred in student-achievement data during district-wide implementation of PLCs. Repeated measures ANOVA and pair-wise comparisons revealed statistically significant differences in elementary, middle, and high school achievement on the TAKS in reading after 3 years( 2006-2010) of district-wide implementation of PLCs. A small effect size of.33% for mean percentage passing in elementary reading was noted( Table 1). Large effect sizes of.75% for middle schools and.67% for high schools were noted for mean percentage passing in reading( Tables 2 and 3). # The answer to the second research question was that teachers at elementary, middle, and high schools believed that PLCs provided avenues for them to learn and positively impacted their classroom practices. Teachers ' responses from audio-taped focus-group interviews led to 16 categories and 2 subcategories of valuable feedback( see Figure). These categories and subcategories provided support for four major themes :( a) collaborative teacher learning ;( b) data-driven decisions ;( c) curriculum, instruction, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Collaborative teacher learning. Each participating teacher agreed that professional collaboration was facilitated on his or her campus. The process of building knowledge and support was collaborative, either by learning from colleagues or learning from other sources. Teachers expressed appreciation for opportunities to learn with their teams rather than in isolation. For example, teachers reported that their knowledge was increased when they compared and contrasted different techniques they used to help students master the TAKS standards in reading. Curriculum specialists were invited to present at PLCs, which increased teacher knowledge. At some schools, teachers reported that principals participated in book studies along with them. # Data-driven decisions. Teachers reported that data from multiple sources, such as teacher observations and anecdotal notes, student work samples, weekly common assessments, district database, TAKS scores, Iowa Test of Basic Skills( ITBS) scores, and Scholastic Achievement Test( SAT) scores were used to inform instruction. Those interviewed indicated that the majority of time in their PLCs was focused on student assessment data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data revealed weaknesses in their instructional practices. # Curriculum, instruction, and student learning. Teachers outlined several reading skills and teaching strategies they discussed during PLCs to address students ' needs collectively. Reading discussions centered around, but were not limited to, the following skills : fluency, inference, vocabulary development, analysis of characters, theme, tone, mood, context clues, and critical thinking. Effective instructional strategies teachers discussed during PLCs and used to help students master reading skills and strategies entailed use of common academic language, hands-on activities, projects, graphic organizers, rhymes, mnemonic devices, real-life situations, skill-based small groups, and student-generated class presentations. # School culture. Several patterns emerged from teacher responses by subject, level, academic-performance ratings, ethnicity, gender, and experience. Most notable was that all teachers agreed that professional collaboration was implemented on their campuses. Moreover, teachers at the high-performing schools found that collaborating before school, in the hallways, during lunchtime, and other times of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaborative culture assured that all teachers had a forum for questions and problem-solving. # Discussion # Findings in the current study provided three main implications for practice in school districts, as well as practice in the private sector. First, this study contributed to research on PLCs by providing further evidence that potent connections among student achievement, teacher collaboration, and change continue to exist in the 21st century( Chin &amp; Benne, 1969 ; Little, 1982 ; Sparks, 1983 ; Guskey, 1985 ; NSDC, 2001 ; Castle, Arends, &amp; Rockwood, 2008). Significant increases in the reading mean percentage passing on the TAKS occurred during district-wide implementation of PLCs. The extent of collaboration that focused on student achievement among teachers may have accounted for variations in the overall mean percentage passing score for each school. If teachers only collaborated formally, their participation in PLCs may have been to project compliant behavior rather than to analyze students ' data. This implication is consistent with previous research that change is gradual and challenging( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. # Second, because student achievement in reading appeared to improve as a result of district-wide implementation of PLCs, this urban school district should continue PLCs as a professional-development strategy for K-12 teachers. In the current study, teachers reported that during PLCs they learned by collaborating with one another and from other sources. This implication provided further evidence that an established culture of teacher collaboration is critical to student achievement( Little, 1982 ; Hoban &amp; Hastings, 1997 ; Linek et al., 2003 ; Fischer &amp; Hamer, 2010). In 2009, Hord concluded that the most important variable in student achievement is teaching quality. Research presented in this study confirmed that consistent participation in PLCs influenced teaching quality and student learning. # The third implication involves school culture. PLCs seemed embedded in the cultures of campuses rated as Academically Recognized or Academically Exemplary, where more than 80% and more than 90% of the students, respectively, passed the TAKS. For example, focus-group interview data revealed that these teachers collaborated before school, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as during scheduled PLC sessions. These teachers reported that, along with their principals, they identified issues and also collaboratively solved the issues based on data. In contrast, teachers at campuses rated as Academically Acceptable, i.e., with at least a 70% passing rate, reported less collaboration, and, during the interview, they focused on issues such as school-wide discipline, ill-prepared colleagues, and what they considered as lack of principal support. Perception of the principal as detached from PLCs and from the process of problem-solving school-wide issues seemed to contribute to low-performing rates on the TAKS. According to Mokhtari, Thoma, and Edwards( 2009), students showed improvements across all grade levels after the principal established weekly PLCs. Perhaps principals might consider consistently participating in PLCs alongside of teachers to assist with analysis of data and problem-solving to ensure that students ' needs are addressed. # Three limitations affected this study and lay foundation for further research on PLCs in this urban school district. First, several schools included in the study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers and the school 's culture. At the time of data collection, the teachers were not fully acquainted with the principals ' expectations and communication and leadership styles. Therefore, further research is needed to assess truly the impact of the principal and PLC. Second, teachers at Academically Unacceptable campuses opted out of audio-taped focus-group interviews, leaving no insights into their PLCs and school culture. Further research at these campuses would provide insight into strengths, weaknesses, and the type of support that is required to accelerate student performance. Third, the majority of teachers who participated in the focus-group interviews were African American and White females. Future investigations might target feedback from males, Hispanics, Asians, and Native Americans. Additional insights from the perceptions of males and minority teachers could enhance an understanding of the relationship between PLCs, student achievement, and reform. # Conclusion # The PLC is a concept that stemmed from the business sector. When implemented as a professional-development strategy, PLCs can lead to organizational improvements in the areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The purpose of this study was to determine if the reading achievement of students in urban schools increased as a result of weekly teacher collaboration in the form of PLCs. The current study utilized quantitative and qualitative methods and concluded that student achievement increased over a 3-year period. However, based on feedback from teachers, variations in elementary, middle, and high-school achievement may have been related to different variables such as school culture, the level of collaboration between teachers, and involvement of the principal. Finding the right equation for improving any organization is a monumental task. Nevertheless, results from this study provide strong support that collaboration through PLCs is an important piece of the equation for continuous improvement. # Table 1 Repeated Measures ANOVA Results for Met Standard on Elementary Schools TAKS Reading TABLE # Note.
