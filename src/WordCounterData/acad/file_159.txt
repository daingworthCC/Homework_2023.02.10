4021441 Today 's defining phenomenon is the act of terrorism. In Amman, Jordan, the triple hotel bombings in 2005 are a single example. The world today faces unprovoked attacks, random shootings, suicide missions, and genocide. Such acts, though an appalling comment on our civilization, lie embedded in its fabric. Rarely do classic writers interpret them. Yet D. H. Lawrence( 1885-1930) has anticipated such acts in his writing. Beatings, shootings, suicide, murder, and a systematic use of language as hatred all define his work. The contours of violence in Lawrence 's fiction, tracing Modernist preoccupations with the psyche 's dark forces, assume forms that are emergent, aggressive, or infiltrative. Sequentially they culminate in dissonance at many levels of a text. The destabilizing Modernist forces -- of violence in Lawrence 's plots and language ; of dissonant harmonic progressions in Berg 's and Bartok 's compositions ; of colliding Cubist planes in Pablo Picasso 's art, which alter a subject 's identity-all reflect new forms of order that arrived in avant-garde culture about 1910. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence has not been demonstrated. <p> Modernist departures from historical frames are well known and extend to much of Lawrence 's work. Throughout his textbook. Movements in European History( 1921), Lawrence implies that cycles of history always encode eruptions of violence. Historians agree that conditions that spawn systemic social disorder-such as threats to peace and prosperity or the sustained oppression of one group by another -- also spawn personal disorder. However, Lawrence 's posture on history 's intersection with violence differs from what might be expected. Because his intuition and understanding go so deep, his writings resist, rather than embrace, historical pressures. Indeed, for most twentieth-century writers, history provides a rich set of possibilities out of which a character 's identity -- of entrapment, freedom, rootedness, and progress-may be fashioned. But Lawrence goes further. In his fiction, he offers a set of circumstances that his characters challenge ; they demand neither social nor intellectual recognition but personal empowerment. Part of Lawrence 's modernity is that -- for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is registered as a set of inherited human prejudices that are antagonistic to instinct and intuition. These prejudices intersect with a panoply of options in the present, out of which an ambiguous future unfolds. <p> Departing from the idioms of nineteenth-century representation, Lawrence and Picasso( as a representative Modernist) choose strikingly elemental, then increasingly violent, forms to represent their vision. Indeed, Lawrence 's characters often move toward a fateful or violent act linked in its contours to history, then shy away from it-rejecting, or repressing, or evading it. Young Ursula Brangwen, Gerald Crich, the Woman Who Rode Away, the Man Who Died, and Connie Chatterley illustrate this unexpected response. They take the events that befall them and, by personal force, subvert them, shaping their dissident response into a preference( early phase), a personal stand( middle phase), or an ideology( late phase) that will help complete their destiny. Sometimes, to relieve a character from the pull of historical events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, as it does for Captain Hauptmann, Jill Banford, and Domingo Romero, for whom death ends a protagonist 's sexual entanglements. Lawrence 's images of violence link the unfolding of historical events to the human struggle against them. <p> As might be expected, these forms of violence reflect Lawrence 's own trajectory as a writer. In his early phase( 1905-1915), violence typically images the disruptive class differences that alter human relationships, as when, in Sons and Lovers, Walter Morel hurls a drawer at his wife Gertrude. In Lawrence 's middle phase( 1916-1924), violence illuminates characters caught in roles they must alter in order to attain personal and spiritual fulfilment, as when Gerald Crich 's fratricide shatters his inner self. In Lawrence 's final phase( 1925-1930), violence, evermore verbal, generates fresh narrative risks and stirs characters like Oliver Mellors and the Man Who Died to dismantle social constraints in order to find sexual liberation : and in this phase Lawrence moves violence to the narrative edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, to which I will return. <p> Early Phase <p> In Lawrence 's early writing, violence is localized -- in a family or job -- and arises mostly from class conflict embedded in economic inequality. This is the conflict Lawrence knew from experience. Characters who struggle upward encounter daunting obstacles. In " The White Stocking "( composed and revised 1907-1914), Elsie Whiston 's flirtatious bid for Sam Adams 's affection is a disguised plea for her husband Ted to discipline her capricious behavior. No longer occupied by work, having quit her warehouse job to get married, she is bored. Her " mischievous " nature attracts Sam 's florid, half-sincere attentions. Unable to bear her disloyalty, Ted strikes his wife " with a crash across the mouth "( 148). Her bleeding wound, however, exposes " the shame " and " the violence " of his act( 162,163). Once Ted has folded her in his arms, the reader understands that Ted 's hard slap will foster healing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elsie and Sam 's whimsical game with her confused need for attention. In the story 's emotional equation, Elsie 's blood is the price of her dalliance. Chastised, she may now mature into a woman who values afresh her husband 's quiet strength. Nevertheless, Lawrence ignores neither Ted 's mute, inarticulate nature nor Sam 's sensuous appeal to Elsie. Although the reader never doubts Elsie 's inner fidelity to Ted, it is clear that violence brokers the inability of both characters to articulate their inner feelings. <p> Whereas Elsie and Ted 's conflict is defined partly by a phase in history when middle-class women did not work after marriage, the Orderly in " The Prussian Officer, " a story composed a year before the Great War began, shows the destabilization of military order. At the outset, the Orderly 's bruises are a hidden badge of his peasant endurance : soon he can march " almost without pain "( 1). Hugh Stevens has said that the Orderly 's bruises allow the Captain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( 55). Indeed, the boy has no other name ; his body is bounty to be claimed. But the story 's violence works differently : it registers the Orderly 's rage -- and despair -- in such eloquent detail that the reader suspects the boy has been violated. Yet his bruises are equally an expression of Captain Hauptmann 's repressed sexual feeling, inflected as eyes of " cold fire "( " Prussian Officer " 2). The story, revealing the secret origin of abuse, shows the Captain punishing what he can not consciously desire. Despite his passion. he subscribes " to the idea of the Service, " using historically validated structures as his guide. He is wedged between the discipline he prizes as an officer and the crumbling sexual mores of a modern era. Earlier he had gambled away his money ; now, addicted to the Orderly 's presence, he gambles away his honor and self-control. He can not keep himself " suppressed "( 4). <p> The men 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate Ted Whiston and Sam Adams, reveal the inherent advantages of birth ; the Captain is " a gentleman " who keeps his Orderly in " subjection "( " Prussian Officer " 4, 12). In the conflict that follows, the boy-instinctual and ordinary-has no access to power. When hit by a belt, blood rushing to his mouth, he must accept the violence as beyond his control and ignore the Captain. When brutally kicked, he clings to a wooden banister for support. He can not escape his duty, which obligates him to serve only three, then only two, more months. And when forced into a personal connection with the Captain, he refuses the obligation it implies and commits the most violent of acts-breaking the Captain 's neck. Fleeing, the Orderly escapes not into freedom but into the subtle captivity of mental derangement, when " everything went black "( 17). Still, when both men are laid side by side in the morgue, Lawrence stresses not their contrasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but rather their equality. On the surface, violence has erased the historical pressures of class. Lawrence never returned to this kind of ending -- not because it is false but because his conception of character and history changed after 1914, when Modernist values emerged. <p> In The Rainbow( 1915) -- Lawrence 's most historical novel 1 -- violence, embedded now in a family 's evolution, becomes internalized without a traditional frame, just as Picasso 's 1910 Cubist portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler shatters the frame into dozens of interacting planes that dissect the human figure( see Plate 1). The light splits the figure ; the pensive head assumes a bestial repose ; and at the base, clasped hands pray for release. 2 Similarly, violence erupts in The Rainbow at the center of Ursula Brangwen 's contemporary experience, breaking down the enclosures around her. As a teacher, she beats an insolent boy ; as a lover, her sexual energy turns corrosive and violent ; and as a pregnant mother, she aborts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sensuality and lust( 280), Ursula releases her powerful instinctual forces ; the cultural dislocations of the twentieth century have separated Anna as breeder from Ursula as aborter. In contemporary times, the sexual act, even in Women in Love, produces no children ; even Pussum chooses an abortion. <p> In The Rainbow manifestations of violence mark Lawrence 's newly discovered antagonisms of an individual caught in familial, social, and historical constraints. Ursula 's antagonism escalates until she can repudiate the way industrialism, so thoroughly the product of history, gives birth to a new colliery town named Wiggiston, which enslaves the colliers and demeans their wives. Early, Ursula registers its human violence. She sees the colliers as " spectres, " their bodies " subjected to slavery, " their town a " gruesome dream, " while day and night the " monster " colliery runs( 393,397). Inspired by her fury, she wishes to destroy the colliery just as the Orderly wishes to destroy the Captain. Like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male prerogative and power. Like the Captain, her uncle Tom Brangwen, who manages the Wiggiston colliery, becomes " disintegrated " when he conies to " the end of his desires "( 392). However, Ursula can escape from Wiggiston and, though with difficulty, turn her back on whatever violates her. As a means of discarding Anton Skrebensky 's deathly love, Ursula must submit to a cleansing : she must endure the terrifying energy of trampling horses, galloping close by, which threaten to annihilate her. <p> As they often do in Modernism, dark psychic forces threaten a character 's stability. 3 Once the Orderly 's homicide and Ursula 's terror pass, Lawrence parallels their respective emotional breakdowns, which violence precipitates. Both become seriously ill, the Orderly succumbing to shock, Ursula trembling in bed. Both reach their limits, entering a stage of delirium in which distortion replaces perception. Alone with their pain, both cast off the husk of emotional support that had once helped them define their core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie unprotected. " There had been father and mother and sweetheart. What did they all matter now, " the Orderly hallucinates( " Prussian Officer " 18). Unable to survive, he dies. In a feverish state. Ursula repeats, " I have no father nor mother nor lover.they are all unreal "( Rainbow 545). Unwilling to bind herself to the dutiful subjection that limits Skrebensky, Ursula miscarries. This is the Modernist crux -- to be reborn without a frame. beyond the parameters of history. <p> Middle Phase <p> In Lawrence 's early fiction, characters redefine themselves suddenly and decisively. By resisting the pressure to conform, they choose personal integrity over social accommodation. In the decade after 1915, however, Lawrence 's understanding of how violence affects character changed : World War I altered his sensibility. After the war, Picasso, for instance, turned to theatrical work, then to paintings of violence( 1925), the crucifixion( 1930), and other forms of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into society, organizations, and industrialization -- at the border of risk, fear, and danger. Violence now determines the fate of Lawrence 's characters and more stringently reveals their values. Composed between 1915 and 1919, Women in Love and The Fox offer a death by gunshot. Earlier, in The Trespasser( 1912), Siegmund, who is unable to broker the space between purity and guilt, commits suicide ; it is the only door " he could open in this prison corridor of life "( 202). The pathos of the ending, miming the actual suicide of Herbert Macartney( on whom Siegmund is based), suggests neither the embedding of fate in the human fabric nor the harder scrutiny that the narrator will soon turn on flawed characters. Using violence as a metonym for war. Lawrence manifests his greater understanding of the pressures exerted on vulnerable characters like Gerald Crich and Jill Banford. <p> Like a blight, an accidental shooting broods over Women in Love, inviting Birkin, Gudrun, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence in the web of fate. Gerald 's misdeed stirs Birkin to reflect : " Gerald as a boy had accidentally killed his brother. What then? Why seek to draw a brand and a curse across the life that had caused the accident?. Is there no such thing as pure accident? " Birkin thinks there is not : " It all hung together, in the deepest sense "( 26). To reach a firm conclusion, he must await intimate knowledge of Gerald 's character. Meanwhile, others respond to the shooting. While Ursula attributes the violent death to an unconscious will, her sister Gudrun flatly dismisses the idea, destabilizing the meaning of violence. Ursula persists, worrying that an unconscious will had motivated the accident : <p> " This playing at killing has some primitive desire for killing in it, do n't you think? " " No, " said Gudrun. " It seems to me the purest form of accident. "( 49) <p> Lawrence initiates a more complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been " tortured by a furious and destructive demon "( 229). Gerald 's natural association with violence is the legacy of his accidental shooting. The slain brother 's torn flesh is soon transferred imaginatively to the torn, bleeding flesh of Gerald 's mare. Gudrun turns white to see " on the mare 's very wound the bright spurs come down, pressing relentlessly "( 112). With its overtones of rape, the image of violent penetration persists. An abusive master, a sadist beneath his civility, Gerald horrifies Ursula, excites Gudrun, and persuades the reader to connect violence, power, and ownership. Indeed, Lawrence forcefully positions the Crich family in history -- to define the family 's power, to reveal its greed( nicely camouflaged by Mr. Crich 's charity), and to clarify its hypocritical posture of " social honor "( 209). The whole violent history of the miners ' strike grounds the family 's ambition in sham service to itself and others, while Mrs. Crich 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> Still, Gerald 's " demon " remains. The trauma of his fratricide contributes to his growing psychic split, typical of Modernism, between vitality and nullity. Having made the mines supremely efficient, he suffers from " not knowing who he was. " He sees in the mirror blue eyes that, if they burst, might induce his " annihilation "( 232). Fearing the chaos of a breakdown, terrified that his reason will vanish, and separated from the everyday world, Gerald confronts a crisis of confidence in his own character. As violence works its way into his interior life, he imagines that Gudrun 's beauty and sexual energy can heal the split that defines him. The early action of the gun " going off turns into Gerald 's orgasmic gun going off when his " terrible frictional violence of death filled Gudrun "( 344), not with the potent substance of life but with the discharge of despair. 4 When Gerald pleads for her help. Gudrun -- " caught at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( 325) -- instills new life in him beyond the confines of his family 's troubled history. <p> Yet Gerald has chosen a woman whose appetite for violence matches his. Gudrun has freed herself from Gerald 's concern with " social position " meshed in history( 375). and by remaining fiercely independent and even refusing to teach, she can attack him. Near the close, a " fine blade "( 421) penetrates his heart just as his phallic spur had, reciprocally, penetrated the mare 's flesh. As Gerald walks away from social position, work, and the possibility of love-edging toward annihilation-readers recognize a symmetry : that the hands that had earlier gripped the gun are the hands whose " wrists were bursting " with violent power. In the snow, Gerald grabs Gudrun 's throat, and " the more violent the struggle became, the greater the frenzy of his delight "( 472). At the close, the unconscious force of violence has spent itself. As Birkin had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " Yet Gerald 's kind of " frenzy " has -- once Lawrence reaches the year 1924 -- already lost its sexual component of " delight " and been redefined, placed deep in the psyche as destructive energy. 5 It is also where Picasso positions violence in his brutal paintings of 1925. <p> In Lawrence 's middle phase, Banford 's death in The Fax illustrates the sweeping dislocations of a world war that hastened the innovations of Modernism. These dislocations reach even the lives of Nellie March and Jill Banford, who, in rural isolation, struggle without men to survive. Henry Grenfel, uprooted from his grandfather 's farm and trained as a soldier. returns from the war full of masked aggression. He is determined to conquer March 's resistance to him. That resistance includes a sexual enemy in the form of Banford. As in war, enemies must be vanquished, and Lawrence links Banford 's death to Henry Grenfel 's decision to shoot the fox. The fox wants the chickens ; Banford wants March as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife. It is an equation that must balance desire with aggression. All three characters connive : the fox slithering toward the hens " like a snake "( 39) ; Banford steering Henry away from the farm ; and Henry himself, with his mantle of " male destiny "( 49), targeting Banford. Thus he must demonize Banford as a " queer little witch "( 55), her hair turning gray, her body frail, and her manner petulant and jeering. <p> In the two deaths that follow -- the shooting of the( as-if-human) fox and the tree striking Banford 's neck -- March is doubly shocked : she is astonished by her erotic discovery of the fox 's phallic brush, " full and frictional "( 41), and by the sudden finality of Banford 's death, but she is also crippled by her sexual confusion : the fox 's sharp smell, redolent with male pheromones, alarms her. All of this is compounded by her brooding insecurity about the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appetite for the male body, March 's body has not yet awakened to Henry 's. She is curiously reticent, shy, and unavailable. Just as Mr. Crich 's death releases Gerald 's sexual potency but not his ability to love, so the violence of Banford 's death releases March 's sexual availability but not her ability to recommit herself emotionally. Like the fox, whose mesmerizing stare disables March 's " masculine " pursuit of him, Henry insists on March 's femininity. His simplifying idea is that she must be demure, domestic, and vulnerable. <p> As Picasso remarked in 1909, " I paint objects as I think them, not as I see them "( qtd. in Schwartz 59). A psychosexual component enters Modernist art. expressed most saliently across Lawrence 's middle works when his characters twist their personal lives to fit an idea of what they should become. Lawrence boldly transfers Gerald Crich 's interior damage into more overt forms of violence -- in the gunshot death of Egbert( in " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Countess Mitchka 's slaying in a Salzburg riot( in The Captain 's Doll, composed 1921) ; in a bomb smashing a Florentine caf( in Aaron 's Rod, also composed 1921) ; and in the fatal shooting of a political leader( in Kangaroo, composed 1922). Beginning with Gerald and March, Lawrence 's characters discover a peculiar problem with human contact. They seem ready for commitment, then turn ambivalent, as if what attracts also repels. In this regard, Richard Lovatt Somers, Dolly Urquhart, and the Woman Who Rode Away are disillusioned, middle-aged figures who are emotionally incomplete and lose their faith in others to fulfill them. Acts of violence relieve their psychological confusion between desiring and not desiring others. In Lawrence 's middle works, a violent death furthers the " splitting " of character and occurs just outside the constraints of history, where characters are escaping from the fetters of the past. <p> At first, Lawrence 's novel Kangaroo, like The Fox, only hints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shared life of domestic partners whose emotional bond is gradually destabilized by a man. Like Banford and March, Richard Lovatt Somers and his outspoken wife Harriet are comfortable in a rhythm of shared work and conversation. And like March, Somers is at first ambisexual, a " queen bee "( 95) to the hive of empowering males. As Somers vibrates to the pheromones of Jack Callcott -- and later Ben Cooley and Willie Struthers -- listening intently to their rhetoric of leadership, change, and male solidarity -- he recognizes a hard truth about himself : marriage has given him contentment but not fulfilment. He needs to connect himself to male power and. renewed with integrity of purpose, to be reborn as a man. <p> When the novel shifts direction in the " Nightmare " chapter, introducing a sequence of disorder, Somers refocuses himself and becomes disconnected from history. Offered a role in male politics when Willie Struthers invites him to edit a people 's newspaper, Somers panics. Out of his panic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erupts " out of the violent past "( 212) and will redefine him. By immersing himself in the molten magma of his unconscious. Somers can gradually account for his fury. Negotiating the suspicion, lies, and espionage that haunted his life in Cornwall( as it did Lawrence 's), Somers uncovers the spiritual dimension of the damage he suffered and, by wrestling with it, discharges what Lawrence calls " the accumulating forces of social violence "( 260). What remains is the potent mystery of aloneness to which his thought and feeling lead him. " Now, all he wanted was to cut himself clear. To be clear of humanity altogether, to be alone. " Rejecting the violence of history, Somers retreats into his own soul. Hence, when violence arises in the Australian Diggers movement, he has already clarified his response. A noncombatant in the war, he will be a noncombatant in Australia. He arrives at a hard truth : the politicized work of men hides the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and obedience. This structural design, so necessary in battle, kills the communion of mates. Somers therefore has no role. He retreats to his marriage, where he can privately commune with " the old dark gods "( 265). Harriet, the figure of greatest stability, anchors him. History and violence give way to solitary detachment and hard-won insight ; male solidarity gives way to the sole self repairing its split psyche. <p> So far, it is clear that violence serves several interrelated ends in Lawrence 's fiction : it abstracts characters from history ; puts them in closer, elemental touch with their being ; and offers them the chance of renewal even though, paradoxically, renewal may devastate the existing order and its human relationships. The risk of devastation increases in Lawrence 's later fiction. After Kangaroo and its baffling mate experiment, Lawrence redefines violence in a series of female characters who -- at the end of an arduous, exhausting physical journey-also reach a state of aloneness roughly parallel to Ursula 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disordering their existence. Selfish, irrational forces, typical of Modernism, determine their behavior. <p> " The Princess "( composed 1924) traces a woman 's exhilarating ascent into mountains and culminates in a violent death whose most notable effect is its lack of compassion. Lawrence reworks the fluttering Banford and sets her down in New Mexico as a middle-aged spinster named Dollie Urquhart, sarcastically called the Princess. Lawrence gives her( as he gave Banford) a female companion ; some family money ; and a coy. bullying temperament. Dollie 's eyes dance with " sardonic ridicule "( 167) ; she despises " being thwarted "( 173). But there the similarities end, for the Princess possesses only a slight capacity to connect her inner self to others. From Domingo Romero. however -- the handsome Mexican who guides her into the daunting Rocky Mountains-she coyly invites a sexual encounter. Then, willing herself to be " a victim "( 189). she fixes to regain her independence and discard the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into anger, retaliation, and " violent excess "( 193) when, shooting at an officer who approaches their campsite, Romero is in turn calmly shot to death. 6 <p> Reflecting Lawrence 's increasingly disillusioned response to the world, Romero 's death by gunshot is recorded without passion : violence is a sign of disorder rather than a human tragedy ; it merely works out the Princess 's sexual ambivalence. Instead, Lawrence 's sympathy attaches to the wild landscape. Against the blue sky. for instance, the Princess notices " the great slopes, dark with the pointed feathers of spruce, bristling with grey dead trees among grey rock, or dappled with dark and gold. " She sees " cruel mountains, with their moments of tenderness "( 179). Restorative energy now emanates from Landscape, not humans. Human connections are diseased, and at the close, the frail vessel of nineteenth-century womanhood is turned upside down and despised. Lawrence 's language bristles with veiled hatred. Anger moves to the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that violence gradually becomes more masked even as it becomes more marked ; nor is it a surprise that history barely touches " The Woman Who Rode Away, " a brilliant story composed in 1924 at the Kiowa Ranch in New Mexico. As Lawrence turns history into myth, the 33-year-old Woman casts her history behind her. She leaves the safety of her house for the " lawless and crude " country( 43). She never thinks of her husband and two children, never wishes to return from her journey to the Chilchui Indians, and never deplores her loss of freedom after the Indians capture her. Instead, impersonal forces-sun, moon, and wind, each with a unique cosmic identity-replace traditional narrative markers of specificity ; landscape becomes particularized but generic : and the Woman reaches a timeless place " far from everywhere "( 41), Similarly, the identities of the characters are stripped down, abstracted. The Woman and her children have no names, the Indians are described by age and hair color, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbols. The historical context is vague. <p> It is not that Lawrence has ignored conventional narration or that his fable about strong-willed women hides behind a mythic shield ; rather, Lawrence deliberately rejects the conventions of social realism in order to destabilize the sexual impulse. The violent apotheosis at the end absorbs and deflects it. Deliberately distancing readers from the Woman and her captors. Lawrence reduces the story to its elemental forces : the Woman derives little satisfaction from the exchange of words but gladly hears " the vast sound of the earth going round, like some immense arrow-string booming "( 59). Some readers, alarmed by the story 's violent ending of female sacrifice, worry that it both abuses and marginalizes women. In this story, however, Lawrence artfully creates forms of consciousness and expression that precede language. He attempts to locate consciousness in silence before utterance alters its purity. Hence the story 's sentences move back and forth between motion and stillness, passion and withdrawal, male cruelty and female compassion -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passionate anger, view the Woman as their catharsis. She will open the cosmic path to their revitalization : <p> <p> They were so impersonal, absorbed in something that was beyond her. They never saw her as a personal woman : she could tell that. She was some mystic object to them, some vehicle of passions too remote for her to grasp.. The immense fundamental sadness, the grimness of ultimate decision, the fixity of revenge.these things she could read in their faces, as she lay and was rubbed into a misty glow by their uncanny dark hands. <p> Oiled fingers, the language of touch, give the Woman 's consciousness a cosmic voice, " diffusing " it into space like a cremation and calling mutely to the sun-god 's power : " Her limbs, her flesh, her very bones at last seemed to be diffusing into a roseate sort of mist, in which her consciousness hovered like some sun-gleam in a flushed cloud "( 67). Violence, sublimated to touch, lifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Perceived as a " mystic object, " she nevertheless effectively articulates her responses : " she could tell, " " she could read. " The narrator, mediating the violence to come, sympathizes equally with the Indians ' unspoken rites and the Woman 's articulate understanding. The story lies poised like a bridge between two protagonists, each with a different use of language, each desiring a cosmic connection. <p> As the Woman 's consciousness moves outward into the cosmos and as her " personality " is effaced( just as Picasso had painted out Gertrude Stein 's face in 1906 and replaced it with a mask), so the Indians gather physical momentum -- then eyes gleam with excitement, and their movements awaken with anticipation. The priest 's final violent knife-thrust, miming the sun 's powerful rays, will be the phallic thrust that re-seeds the Indians ' spiritual growth. Indeed, this is a peculiar moment in the development of Lawrence 's art. This is the last time he will sublimate his rage into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he will fully deflect the sexual impulse away from the body. <p> The widely known companion to this story. " The Rocking Horse Winner "( 1927), sends rage inward toward suicide. The story returns to the boy whom the Woman had left behind ; her callous disinterest is repositioned in an equally hard-hearted mother. It also repositions the cosmic secrets the Woman discovers and puts them inside the whispering walls of a house that is emotionally sterile. In this equally shattering story, Lawrence traces the journey of a vulnerable boy named Paul who. when he wins money for his insatiable mother Hester, finally reaches a spiritual consummation, then dies. Paul 's defeat expresses Lawrence 's understanding of the violent psychic damage that characters crushed by guilt incur. As James C. Cowan aptly remarks, Paul 's overwhelming anxiety implies a " violence and destruction that can hardly be missed "( 133). The whispering walls, although they appear to be projections of fate, are not. An " indoors " boy like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls that enclose and restrict his emotional growth. The wooden horse he mounts for relief is equally restricted, rocking to and fro in endless repetition. Both Paul and the Woman ride their horses toward a destination they choose although it is not a destination they fully comprehend. When the walls whisper, " There must be more money! "( 230), Paul responds compliantly, although he does not understand what they mean ; he confuses luck sent from God with the hard-won bargain of psychic knowledge paid for with human life. Equally disturbed, the Woman-swayed by turn-of-the-century romanticism -- also feels that she must exit a life that is " going wrong "( " Woman Who Rode Away " 40). Like Paul, the Woman feels " a strange elation " as she rides( 44). <p> Both Paul and the Woman reach the same kind of fulfilment-death in the service of an idea( greed, rebirth) that empowers others. They willingly sacrifice themselves. Assisting them on their journeys are devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish-speaking cacique -- who are guides to the baffling world beyond their own. Bassett places Paul 's bets, translating his hunches into cash ; the young cacique calms the Woman and translates her Spanish. At the close of both stories, violence is presented inversely : Paul 's psychic agony in the throes of death echoes the Woman 's calm, and Hester 's shallow social engagements echo the Indians ' deeply empowering social rituals. The Indians achieve a relieved affirmation ; Hester will endure the bitter recriminations of an egocentric woman. Behind both stories lies a violence hidden by ideas of sacrifice that ennoble the Indians but show Hester to be ignobly selfish. Behind both ties a barely concealed hatred that infiltrates Lawrence 's late work in startling new ways. <p> Late Phase <p> Lawrence 's last years reveal the fiery intensity with which he set about recentering sexual intercourse beyond social and historical pressures. His effort, against the grain of his own sharp physical decline, demanded courage and fortitude. 7 It also unleashed uncommon kinds of energy. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in narratives of entrapment and escape. His ferocity puts his late work in fresh narrative territory, where acts of profound disrespect and even violence are repositioned at the edge of discovery. Two late works that overlap chronologically illustrate the change as history, marginalized by violence, turns toward myth. 8 <p> Lady Chatterley 's Lover( 1926-28) and The Escaped Cock( 1927-28, published by Alfred Knopf as The Man Who Died) initially portray characters in a sharply defined historical sequence : post-World War I and post-Crucifixion respectively. The crucifixion of the Man Who Died( it was painted irreligiously by Picasso in 1930) leaves its profound physical and moral imprint ; biblical references explain his wounds. Similarly, the First World War cripples Clifford Chatterley in 1918( Lawrence is very specific about dates) ; it damages Mellors 's health ; and it disillusions Connie Chatterley and the narrator. Whereas Connie and Mellors ultimately bypass the whorl of economic necessity. Clifford joins the march of scientific progress as history unfolds in new fuels, new efficiencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seam that links history and myth rests on violence and is articulated in a pair of scenes that empower characters while eliciting their potent disdain. As the Man Who Died recovers his strength and sets out to embrace the phenomenal world, he frees a cock at an inn, which defeats its feathered antagonist and collects a harem of hens. Aggressive and sure, he does what the Man can not. In the story 's second part, set in Lebanon, the fowl reappears as a pigeon that also escapes its captors, who are a pair of young slaves belonging to Isis in Search. What is remarkable about this second scene is both the nexus of fury and sex and the pair of silent, passive witnesses : <p> <p> A black-and-white pigeon.had escaped. The priestess heard the cry of the boy slave, a garden slave of about seventeen. He raised his arms to heaven in anger as the pigeon wheeled away, naked and angry and young he held out his arms. Then he turned and seized the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his fist that was stained with pigeon 's blood. And she lay down with her face hidden, passive and quivering. The woman who owned them watched. And as she watched, she saw another onlooker,. a dark-bearded man standing on the little causeway of rock.. The boy suddenly left off beating the girl.. He twisted her over, intent and unconscious, and pushed his hands between her thighs, to push them apart. And in an instant he was in to her, covering her in the blind, frightened frenzy of a boy 's first coition.. The priestess turned away. Slaves!. She was not interested.( 36-37) <p> Lawrence 's tableau links power, rage, and sex. The girl, though resisting, is " passive. " The two onlookers are virgins, for whom the sexual act, even allowing for Lawrence 's abbreviated description, might be expected to arouse surprise, stimulation, even disgust. The two onlookers are disengaged viewers : they simply watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so, they offer a clue to Lawrence 's altered attitude toward history. As with the Woman Who Rode Away, whose anticipated death stirs tribal rejoicing, the actions in this novella allow Isis and the Man to stand apart, isolated from the people 's daily lives, which are supervised by Isis 's mother and the overseer. Instead, absorbed in a religious dream, Isis and the Man are disdainful of public life ; they find comfort and meaning only in private commitments -- for her, serving a goddess ; for him, escaping from the role of prophet. They withdraw. Meeting privately in the temple, they reject even the use of ordinary names -- that public convenience for labeling, recording and individualizing : " You are Osiris, are n't you? " she asks naively. " If you will, " he replies( 53). Later, she says to herself : " He is Osiris. I wish to know no more "( 59). As with Mellors, his distinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The loss of identity is part of the process of abstraction that also characterizes music and art between 1910 and 1930. <p> Figures in a myth can be readily abstracted, detached from historical necessity, to create a new kind of order : the Woman has drawn apart ; the Man has gotten free. Both embrace the religious impulse even as they reject family bonds, the Man becoming just what Mellors fears -- a Lady 's " fucker, " engaging in sex at the edge of discovery, where servants will gossip : even Isis 's servants, even Mrs. Bolton. There is a cost. As Connie Chatterley and her sister Hilda, living in Scotland, may need to raise Connie 's child by themselves, so Isis and her widowed mother will, alone, raise the child the Man has fathered. An economic nexus underlies these anticipated events. Unlike most women, Isis has possessions-temple, slaves -- that her mother can not touch, just as Connie has 20,000 in trust from her mother that Clifford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man 's vitality, has lost its power to unite man and woman into a family : " Oh do n't go! " Isis cries when the Man draws away. " I will build a house.where we can live apart "( Escaped Cock 60). Fearing revenge from the widow, the Man refuses. Separation, isolation, aloneness, privacy, and contemplation -- these are the values that Lawrence 's novella embraces. They lead to temporary human connections, to stolen moments of pleasure across long stretches of waiting. Myth, not history, allows fulfillment. The books ' most arresting image shows the goddess striding forward, ever in motion, always in search. She could be the first Connie Chatterley. <p> What distinguishes Lady Chatterley 's Lover is the way its many surface dichotomies of language and silence, culture and nature, Wragby and wood are so forcefully undone by the novel 's narrative voicings, which( in Modernist fashion) are multiple, dissonant, and unstable. The novel may be deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence, it portrays a wholly destabilized culture -- industrially, socially, morally, and personally. Its sense of family is highly provisional : Clifford 's family members have all died( he will have no heir), Mellors 's widowed mother is left behind, Michaelis and Hilda remain unmarried, Mrs. Bolton has long been a widow, Miss Bartlett is an old maid, and Squire Winter( the last of his line) dies. All the rooted forms of life are breaking up. The Tewsons, the sole intact family in which both husband and wife appear, are discarded from the novel 's third version. In this provisional atmosphere, Connie and Mellors also withdraw from patterns of social obligation, Connie evading her wifely duty whenever she can and Mellors living apart from his wife, mother, and daughter. Having destabilized the novel, Lawrence artfully repositions violence, giving it new forms -- ostensibly in a rape whose aggression is masked, but more interestingly in rhetorical loops that constitute a major expression of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeper, carrying a gun, frightens her ; before long, he shoots and kills a poaching " pussy " in front of his daughter. A reader of Lawrence 's work will readily link the keeper 's gun to Gerald Crich 's gun. But now Lawrence redefines these earlier images. The gun is no longer a proleptic image but a reminder of Mellors 's servile status ; the gun is a synecdoche for the distance that he, braced by the mask of a Derbyshire dialect, can impose on those who possess power. <p> Later, Mellors frightens Connie again. In a scene where she goes from Marehay Farm into a dense fir-wood, Lawrence almost masks the signature of a rape. Confronting Connie, Mellors carries her, without her permission, to a pile of boughs. When she does not resist, he breaks the band of her underclothes and, without preparation, enters her. It is a violation masked by his urgency. But in all three versions of the novel, Lawrence swiftly turns the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, discovering " new strange thrills rippling inside her, rippling, rippling, like a flapping overlapping of soft flames.melting her all molten inside "( Lady Chatterley 133). 9 Here is something new -- restorative violence. In the attack, motivated by the keeper 's anger that Connie had eluded him, domination( like the slave girl, she must lie " like an animal " 133) and men sexual penetration awaken Connie 's atrophied senses. Her opposition to his overtures dissolves into gratitude. Mellors has broken her social shield and denied Connie her assumption of class superiority. Earlier, when she thinks of biblical history-recalling that to find a real( i.e. a sexual) man, she might go even " into the streets and by-ways of Jerusalem " - she quickly identifies not the relevance of history but its limits. For Connie it is not worth " sifting the generations of men through her sieve "( 64). The biblical text measures her tie to a morality she must discard as irrelevant because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She must do what Picasso 's portrait of Kahnweiler had earlier done. She must locate her deepest self in the present, outside a frame of constraint. <p> In using violence to recenter the sexual impulse, Lawrence takes pains to pair this quasi-rape scene with the lovers ' night of sensual passion, narrated not as distant onlookers might see it but( this time) indistinctly, as Connie yields the " jungle of herself " to Mellors. In opening her anal canal, Connie( we are told twice) " let him have his way " as he penetrates her " most secret places. " At first she " hated it. " She was " like a slave, " he as " reckless " as the slave-boy. As Connie and Mellors recenter sex in the darkest depths of the body, they purge their fear of social codes. Apparently, the violence of sodomy has been absorbed by passion, indeed welcomed by partners who accept lust as the price of their ultimate bonding. It is interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiat -- no dialogue, little specificity, and mostly assertion, as in " not really love " and " the last and deepest recess of organic shame "( 246-47). That is because Lawrence affirms the novel 's values while assuming the aggressive contempt of his readers. 10 <p> Nevertheless, Lawrence takes the implicit violence of both scenes and distributes it elsewhere-just as Picasso, in his female images of 1925 to 1930, distributes body parts in distorted ways, violently traducing the human figure( for instance, in Sealed Bather of 1930 ; see Plate 2). 11 Lawrence 's violence empties mostly into the narrator 's animosity toward the modern woman, the upper classes, commercial writers, superficial sex, egocentricity, an acquisitive society, and the horrors of industrialization. What astonishes about the narrator 's violence is not that it is verbally aggressive or has so many targets, but that it assumes such odd, simplifying verbal structures. Their counterpart is the skewed anatomy of Picasso 's seated bather. When Lawrence 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself in loops of thought( especially in the novel 's third version), cycling and recycling despised aspects of modern culture. These loops are tightly compressed, ideological variations on ideas like Clifford 's bruised psyche or civilization 's insanity. As Clifford manifests his hatred of those beneath him, " contemptuous of anyone not in his own class "( 15) ; as Connie recognizes her " vivid hate "( 192) of Clifford ; as Bertha too " hates " Mellors( 199) ; as Mellors himself welcomes " the extermination of the human species "( 218) ; and as even Mrs. Bolton finds " a queer hate " flaring inside her( 164) -- so does the narrator develop his own hatred, deeper than theirs, into loops of thought that concentrate a few key gibes into a litany of displaced violence. For Lawrence, violence takes increasingly verbal forms. As these categories expand, the narrator 's hatred loses its defining power and becomes unregulated ; its images diffuse into abstractions -- endless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Embracing the simplification of Modernist art, all decry the collapse of modern culture. 12 <p> Even as Lawrence recenters the sexual impulse, he uses a contrary force of exposure to confound the loops ' force of enclosure. Altering his approach, he masterfully distributes elements of violence to the edge of revelation. Earlier, Ted Whiston discovers Elsie 's perfidy when she confesses to him, then slaps her in quick retribution ; the Orderly, once he has put his " name " on the Captain 's murdered body, simply runs away. In Lawrence 's later work, hatred and hostility creep into the fabric of his fiction and flirt dangerously with discovery. In ' The Rocking Horse Winner, " the walls whisper ever more madly as their secret threatens to destabilize Paul 's world. In " The Lovely Lady "( composed l927), Pauline Attenborough 's secrets -- she seduced a priest and caused her son, Henry, to kill himself -- dangle at the edge of a drainpipe and threaten to expose her fraudulent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close of The Escaped Cock, the Man, having Haunted his sexual presence under the nose of the Roman overseer, narrowly escapes his potential captors. <p> What has changed is no breakthrough in vision. 13 What has changed is Lawrence 's daring and direction. In his earlier fiction he could offer an event like Siegmund 's suicide as the simple outcome of despair ; now he brings the characters ' hidden animosities closer to discovery. While Connie pushes Clifford 's chair, she kisses Mellors 's hand just inches from her husband 's proud head. The danger energizes her. When Mrs. Bolton drifts to the window at dawn and sees the lovesick keeper standing in the drive, the revelation crashes through her " like a shot "( Lady Chatterley 145) ; and the reader infers that it could have been Clifford at the window, still awake, spotting his wife 's lover. It is not that Clifford 's consequent rage would unsettle readers. It is that Mrs. Bolton 's excited discovery filters the sudden exposure and conceals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That resentment is a symptom of the novel 's pervasive redistribution of violent emotion. When she glances " triumphantly "( 146) at the already sleeping Clifford, her triumph expresses her identification with Connie, her liking for Mellors, and her antagonism toward inequality. Lawrence 's approach is more daring but also more insolent. Bertha turns vicious ; Mellors openly castigates Hilda and Duncan Forbes ; and even Connie, demure and tactful, complains of Clifford 's " nasty, sterile want of common sympathy "( 193). Sublimated violence gradually infiltrates the style, the dialogue, and the plot of the novel. Lady Chatterley 's Lover is the culmination of violence as art. <p> Lawrence 's art, developing rapidly, follows an evolutionary pattern. As he marginalizes history and as Connie and Mellors embrace the myth of regenerative sexuality. Lawrence discovers ever more powerfully the art of violence. Characters doomed by fate -- Gerald, Banford -- give way to characters like the Woman Who Rode Away and Clifford who accept or adapt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the Woman acquiesces to her fate. Clifford, whom " fate has given a check-mate physically "( Lady Chatterley 44), will re-energize the mines on his estate. As Lawrence reinterprets acts of violence to release the characters ' sexual impulses, he arrives at a final position best described as " the vertical through the horizontal "( Squires 108), where sexual liberation cuts across social constraints, and where the latent energy of violence also enables what Leo Bersani calls Lawrentian stillness. Thus condensed, Lawrence 's final position restates the tension between history and fable that his works have always mediated. <p> The contours of violence in Lawrence 's fiction trace a Modernist sequence-emergent and marginal, inclusive and central, then infiltrative -- that encodes disorder and culminates in multiple forms of dissonance. This loss of order reflects Lawrence 's strong impulse toward destabilizing history as the norm of nineteenth-century narrative. As Lawrence 's protagonists evolve, they are protected by the integrity their intuition confers but almost never by their knowledge or understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decipher " ancient Mexican scripts "( " Lovely Lady " 247) that offer no access to understanding but stir incestuous feelings and provide a ruse to bar Pauline 's niece from their company. Only Clifford depends on books and articles in his work ; Mellors may read books on India and analyze cultural decay, but he remains an observer. Increasingly in Lawrence 's work, history is compressed into memory. It can no longer direct a character 's life. After 1910, writers and artists, though they knew that history grounded their work, rejected the resulting psychic enclosures and broke them down, sometimes violently, in order to live more freely. Resisting historical pressures, Lawrence, like his contemporaries Virginia Woolf and Ernest Hemingway, finds only the present habitable, epitomizing what the Cubists and their followers had also discovered. <p> Finally, the lens of violence clarifies not only the trajectory of Lawrence 's art but also the trajectory of our own century -- from physical pain, to forms of death, to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Lawrence 's use of violence reflects what he observed in his own life but, more importantly, allows him to ponder imaginatively the effects of class and race that are derived from history. Yet it is curious that in Lawrence 's fiction, history creates less a template than an absence. Into this absence come violent cruxes, exposing human weakness and expressing the disunity that intelligent, sensitive characters try to heal. Like a fault line, violence reveals the cracks in a culture as Lawrence explores the disharmonies in England, Mexico. Australia, and America. Today, in a world facing unprovoked forms of aggression, readers may discern that, whether for Lawrence 's fictional characters or for the jihadists that now infiltrate despised regimes, violence can lead to renewed sources of energy( for the Woman Who Rode Away and the Man Who Died) even as it leads to defeat, disillusion, and multiple forms of death. The schisms so pronounced today -- in relationships, politics, and religion-are the harvest of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubled intersection of social and psychological forces. D. H. Lawrence 's foresight powerfully illuminates our own alarming tendencies toward cultural fracture
