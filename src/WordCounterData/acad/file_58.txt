4009141 The current special education literature reflects a vigorous debate regarding the ethics of using aversive and intrusive procedures to reduce or eliminate severe behavior problems. Included in this debate is an extensive discussion of the procedural safeguards for use in special education settings in the rare instances when these interventions are implemented. <p> Corporal punishment is an aversive intervention that is sometimes used with regular and special education students. However, the historical precedent for using corporal punishment in America 's schools has not led to the development or implementation of comprehensive procedural safeguards. <p> While the empirical support for corporal punishment as an effective behavior reduction strategy has not been established, it appears that segments of the lay public and professional educators view corporal punishment as a viable intervention procedure, and may continue to resist abolishment. Therefore, it is proposed that when corporal punishment is to be considered for arty student, comprehensive procedural safeguards be implemented. Applying the suggested procedural safeguards should provide assurances that whenever corporal punishment is anticipated for use in the mainstream, it will be systematically implemented and evaluated, and provide an empirical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishment. <p> The use of nonaversive interventions as opposed to aversive interventions( e.g. noxious aromas, spraying a water mist in a student 's face, electrical shocks) is a topic currently receiving considerable attention in the special education literature. This literature reflects an emphasis on the moral, legal, ethical and empirical issues relating to the use of these techniques( Alberto &; Troutman, 1990 ; Center, 1989 ; Cooper, Heron &; Howard, 1987 ; Morgan &; Jenson, 1988 ; Repp &; Singh, 1990 ; Rusch, Rose &; Greenwood, 1988). The specific procedures for professional accountability when an aversive technique is being considered, are comprehensive and well documented. More specifically, the current special education literature is replete with decision-making models and assessment procedures recommended for use by special educators when selecting even a mild aversive intervention( Beaten, Simpson, Rosell &; Reilly, 1988 ; CCBD, 1990 ; Center,. 1989 ; Cooper, Heron &; Heward, 1987 ; Pyles &; Bailey, 1990 ; Walker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appropriateness of aversive techniques has escalated dramatically during the past decade( Skiba &; Deno, 1990). Numerous special education professionals have communicated that there are alternatives which are more effective and ethical than aversive interventions. Various advocacy organizations have called for the cessation of the use of aversives( Mulick, 1990). The intensity of the call for the elimination of the use of aversives may be illustrated by the following statement, " To argue the merits of using severe punishment or aversives with any person with developmental disabilities, who exhibits self-injurious behavior or behavior that is a danger to others, is immoral and unethical "( Freagon, 1990, p. 154). <p> Conversely, there are special education professionals that view the total abandonment of aversive therapy as an overreaction. Paisey, Whitney and Hilsop( 1990) state : <p> " Claims that aversives are used indiscriminately are without current foundation. Subject to appropriate oversight, there is a recognized need for their application in certain instances. Since contemporary regulations and professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence for prohibition? "( p. 193). <p> In a comprehensive discussion regarding the use of aversive interventions for individuals with mental retardation, Mulick( 1990) indicates that aversive interventions may be appropriate in certain instances, and that the application of best practices requires that the selection of any aversive procedure should occur only if the proper procedural safeguards have been implemented. Additionally, i! was indicated that if these procedures are followed, it would be possible to determine the effectiveness of the intervention and provide a research base on the undesirable side effects. <p> While the technical, moral, legal, and ethical use of aversive stimuli has received considerable attention in the current special education literature, corporal punishment receives relatively little attention. The discussion of corporal punishment often focuses on the negative aspects of the procedure as well as the ethical, legal and moral implications( CCBD, 1990 ; McFadden, 1987). Perhaps due to the lack of support for its use, technical or procedural aspects of implementing corporal punishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schools <p> Yell( 1990) reported that 19 states have outlawed corporal punishment and that it is still legal to paddle children in 31 states. Some local school districts have outlawed corporal punishment or have delineated stringent guidelines( Morgan &; Jensen, 1988). Child abuse laws may also inhibit the use of corporal punishment. Despite the above mentioned bans and deterrents, corporal punishment still remains a legal option in a majority of the nation 's schools. Educators, in some instances are given a tremendous amount of latitude in making the decision to use corporal punishment. For example, if a teacher believes that a student has violated a rule, the teacher often has the right to initiate corporal punishment or refer the student to the principal 's office where most students receive their corporal punishment( Rose, 1989). The typical school procedure for the application of corporal punishment is quite simple ; the teacher or individual administering corporal punishment must have another adult present. <p> How frequently is corporal punishment utilized in schools? According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sample from 16,000 schools districts( n = 3,510) from the 50 states and the District of Columbia, professed that there were 1,332,317 instances of the use of corporal punishment. In addition, Rose( 1989) conducted a national survey of principals selected from the nine census regions and concluded that " Results indicated widespread use of corporal punishment with handicapped students at every grade level in the majority of regions in the United States. "( p. 43). Corporal Punishment, Society and the Courts <p> Society not only views corporal punishment as an acceptable approach to dealing with inappropriate behaviors, but as a constitutional right( Ingraham v. Wright, 1977). In this Supreme Court ruling, paddling a student on the buttocks in the presence of witnesses was not considered to be cruel and unusual punishment. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to give a ruling on a petition for a seriously emotionally disturbed student in the case of Fee v. Herndon( 1991). In reviewing this case, The Special Educator( 1991) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state, ' paddling laws ' must now only meet a standard of reasonableness, even when applied to students with disabilities "( p. 132). Apparently the courts believe that the decision to use or not use corporal punishment with any student, regardless of their educational status, is within the purview of professional educators. <p> It appears that corporal punishment is viewed as a viable option and is used frequently. Consequently, the frequency of the use of corporal punishment and the lack of comprehensive procedural safeguards are indicative of the fact that society views corporal punishment as an appropriate and effective intervention. This perception seems to be more a function of society 's prejudice regarding corporal punishment, rather than being based on empirical evidence of its effectiveness. Therefore, it is critical that educators go beyond the current minimal standards and develop comprehensive procedures for the application and evaluation of corporal punishment. Aversive Interventions, CorporalPunishment and Special Education <p> The special education literature is replete with debates about the use of aversive forms of interventions. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedures, technical, legal and ethical considerations, as well as the result of negative side-effects when using any aversive procedure. <p> Special education teacher training programs often communicate to the prospective teacher that aversive procedures should never be used unless : 1) non-aversive procedures have failed ; 2) the behavior to be eliminated is considered to be seriously detrimental to the individual and/or other individuals in that student 's environment ; 3) there are objective data to suggest the need for the procedure ; 4) the risks and benefits of the procedure are evaluated ; and 5) a multidisciplinary committee obtains the informed consent from the parents. <p> Preservice teachers are frequently instructed that the milder punishment procedures( e.g., response cost, time out procedures) are appropriate interventions when various less intrusive techniques have been implemented and failed. The use of corporal punishment with exceptional students is likely to create more problems than it eliminates. An examination of several of the major special education textbooks( i.e., Alberto &; Troutman, 1990 ; Bos &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jenson, 1988 ; Morgan &; Reinhart, 1991 ; Paul &; Epanchin, 1991 ; Rusch, Rose &; Greenwood, 1988 ; Shea &; Bauer, 1987 ; Walker &; Shea, 1991) which have sections on behavioral reduction strategies provides support for these statements. These textbooks strongly advocate the implementation of nonaversive strategies. Punishment procedures, especially corporal punishment, are either not discussed, not presented as a viable option, or may be an option in select instances, if the proper procedural safeguards are implemented. In the recent special education literature there have been articles which advocate the use of behavioral reduction strategies that focus on non-aversive or less intrusive procedures that have documented empirical merit( Frimian, 1990 ; Spooner, Test, &; Jolly, 1990). <p> While society may view corporal punishment as a viable option, the special education literature obviously reflects a very different viewpoint. For example, Braaten, Simpson, Rosell &; Reilly( 1988) divided punishment procedures into two major categories : traditional and nontraditional. According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional punishment procedures range from planned ignoring to response cost and restitution. They identified the more intrusive and aversive procedures as nontraditional punishment which ranges from time-out exclusion to aversive conditioning. In identifying the traditional and nontraditional punishment procedures they did not include corporal punishment in either category. <p> When special educators are contemplating the use of a procedure which is considered to be aversive in any way, the proper procedural safeguards are required. For example, if the parents and the other members of a special education student 's Individualized Education Program( IEP) committee believe that repeated head banging by the student may cause permanent injury, they may consider an aversive strategy such as spraying a mist of water into the student 's face contingent upon head banging. However, the committee would have selected a set of established procedural safeguards( see Alberto &; Troutman, 1990 ; Center. 1989 ; Morgan &; Jensen, 1988 ; Cooper, Heron, &; Heward, 1987 ; Walker &; Shea, 1991). Corporal Punishment in the Mainstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next door to the IEP committee meeting described above observes a student who disrupts a class while using offensive language. The teacher may decide that the student needs to receive corporal punishment. This teacher may either refer the student to the principal or simply ask another teacher to view the procedure of having the student bend over and be struck on the buttocks with a paddle. Whether or not the teacher had eliminated the disruptive behavior, the procedure was not implemented as part of a systematic behavioral reduction program which applied procedural safeguards. In addition, the procedure could be administered at the discretion of one individual, and neither the student nor the student 's parents had an opportunity to avail themselves of the protection offered by procedural safeguards. Procedural Safeguards in the Mainstream <p> There is a major difference between the decision to spray a child in the face with a mist of water to reduce head banging and a teacher who decides to use corporal punishment to eliminate disruptive behavior and offensive language by a student. The decision to spray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IEP committee which included the student 's parents. The objective was to protect the child from permanent injury. In the second example, the teacher has the option to make a unilateral decision to use corporal punishment to eliminate a disruptive behavior. Regardless of the effectiveness of either of the procedures in eliminating the inappropriate behavior, there is a conspicuous absence of a systematic decision making process and a systematic evaluation of the efficacy of the selected intervention when corporal punishment is being utilized. <p> Most professionals involved in the reduction of severe mal-adaptive behaviors such as self-injurious behavior have either decided that any aversive procedure is unethical( Freagon, 1990), or that they will only use aversive interventions when specific procedural safeguards are followed. However, one individual teacher can make the unilateral decision to strike a student on the bunocks with a paddle. The question that must be addressed is whether any one individual can be allowed to act unilaterally when implementing an aversive procedure, especially one that lacks empirical validation? <p> The administration of corporal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systematic implementation of any punishment procedure. Punishment is to be administered immediately and contingent upon the occurrence of each instance of the inappropriate behavior. Rose( 1989) found that during a five year time period, the time delay had increased between the occurrence of misbehavior and the administration of corporal punishment. Fifty percent of the principals he surveyed indicated that this time delay was more than twenty minutes. Rose( I 989) also indicated that the lack of operational definitions of what constitutes a punishable offense is a contributing factor which may result in corporal punishment not being administered in a systematic fashion. <p> Corporal punishment can be one of the most aversive forms of punishment used by educators. In fact, one can make the argument that it is as aversive, or may be more aversive, than the use of electric shock. For example, an electric shock could make a student cry, but the duration of the painful sensation is designed to be of relatively brief duration. Corporal punishment on the other hand can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, can be very humiliating, and the painful sensation may last well beyond the administration of corporal punishment. Recommendations and Conclusions <p> Given that there is much debate on the use or non-use of aversive stimuli with exceptional students, even in cases where their behavior constitutes a danger to themselves or others, it is critical to expand the debate to include the issue of corporal punishment. It is even more critical at this point in time because approximately 68% of the exceptional student population currently receives most of their education in the regular classroom( USDE, 1990). It probably will be very difficult to convince the general public, including the professionals that administer corporal punishment, to abolish it. The historical and religious background regarding the use of corporal punishment has been ingrained in the consciousness of a significant proportion of society( Haeuser, 1990 ; McFadden, 1987). This reality has been supported by the Supreme Court decision in Ingraham v. Wright(1977). <p> The procedural safeguards that are being suggested are not intended to encourage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assist in ensuring that if corporal punishment is going to be utilized then it will be implemented in a systematic and professional manner. Consequently, schools will be protecting the rights of special and regular education students and minimizing the possibilities of abuse. <p> The following procedural guidelines are being suggested for schools to implement. The behaviors which are subject to corporal punishment should be operationally defined, and the conditions identified under which corporal punishment will be administered. The school should identify a committee which will be responsible for the implementation and monitoring of corporal punishment. The committee members should receive supervision and training in the use of corporal punishment. <p> The committee is then responsible for determining that nonpunitive interventions have been tried and failed, establishing procedures for keeping accurate records of the current and post intervention level of the behavior. The committee should conduct periodic reviews to evaluate whether the corporal punishment procedure should be continued or discontinued. This decision should be based on data regarding the reduction of the target behavior and the presence of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and procedures for implementing corporal punishment, the committee is responsible for obtaining the written consent from the student 's parents or guardians. The process of obtaining parental consent should include the following steps : 1) Providing the parents with all relevant information which includes the rationale for using corporal punishment, how corporal punishment will be administered and the procedures for evaluation. Communication should be in the parent 's or guardian 's native language and free of professional jargon ; 2) Parental consent should be in writing and should include the description of how corporal punishment will be administered and evaluated, as well as information that permission is voluntary and can be revoked at any time. <p> In conclusion, applying the procedural safeguards suggested above should provide assurances that corporal punishment will be systematically implemented and evaluated, and provide an empirical base to evaluate the effects and side effects of corporal punishment. This empirical base would make it possible to determine whether there is a linkage between corporal punishment and the number of suspensions, expulsions, drop outs, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would aid in determining whether corporal punishment leads to the reduction of inappropriate behavior or to the degeneration of students ' ability to cope in their educational programs. <p>
