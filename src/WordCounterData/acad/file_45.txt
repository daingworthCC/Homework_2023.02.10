4007841 The relationship between the Supreme Court and the press has been but a footnote in scholarly analysis of political institutions and the press. Some explanations for that neglect are obvious. Press coverage of the Court is meager, particularly compared to that of Congress or the president.( n1) Moreover, the limited coverage that the Court receives is often criticized as inadequate and superficial.( n2) News coverage tends to be driven by journalistic values rather than legal salience.( n3) Given the scant and often superficial coverage, the lack of scholarly interest is understandable. <p> Yet such elementary explanations fail to address the important question of whether the Court seeks a relationship with the press. The obvious answer would be negative. But is that the correct answer? <p> It is widely assumed that the Court has little interest in the press and public opinion because its only constituency is the legal profession. Such a view implies that the Court has no need or desire to communicate with the press. But Larry Berkson has identified two separate constituencies of the Supreme Court : the legal profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but more important portion of the general public.( n4) This second, more subtle constituency is the base of power for the Court. <p> In Federalist 78, Alexander Hamilton argued that because the Court lacks the power of either sword or purse, it is the branch of government least likely to injure : " It may truly be said to have neither FORCE nor WILL, but merely judgment. "( n5) Without formal constitutional powers, the Court is potentially weak. It should rightly fear that the president, Congress, and the states will not comply with its decisions unless it can assert some authority that they will respect. " The only power that the Court can assert is the power of public opinion.( n6) To succeed, the Court must have the support of the general public. The Court has even acknowledged that need. In carefully formulating its decision in the controversial abortion case Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote that the Court 's legitimacy is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n7) <p> To promote public respect for itself and its decisions, the Supreme Court attempts to project images of expertise, unanimity, and independence. <p> The image of expertise appears in the mystical trappings of the Court, with its robes and rituals, and in the backgrounds of its justices, which suggest the distance of an intellectual, if not social, aristocracy. Unlike other politicians, justices are expected to occupy a social and educational level above that of most citizens.( n8) <p> The image of unanimity is cultivated particularly when the Court 's power is under attack from other institutions. Examples of the Court 's tendency to close ranks when its power is threatened can be seen in the unanimous decisions in the civil rights cases Brown v. Board of Education and Cooper v. Aaron, wherein state governments challenged the authority of the Court, and in U.S. v. Nixon, wherein the president threatened to ignore the Court 's ruling. The intent of the Court to encourage public compliance through its united opinion is hinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other justices, urging that the Brown opinion be " short, readable by the lay public, nonrhetorical, unemotional, and, above all, not accusatory. "( n9) <p> The image of the Court 's independence is acquired by creating the perception of distance from, and immunity to, the political process. The Court 's apparent detachment from politics is made possible by its nonelective status. However, the image requires cultivation. As the Court itself admitted in a well-known opinion, its " authority -- possessed of neither the purse nor sword -- ultimately rests on sustained public confidence in its moral sanction. Such feeling must be nourished by the Court 's complete detachment, in fact and in appearance, from political entanglements. "( n10) <p> Thus the Court must interact with the public to sense what it must do to maintain public confidence and transmit appropriate messages to its most important constituency. But it lacks the mechanisms that enable other political actors to hear from and speak to their publics, such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town meetings. The Court needs an information conduit, and that conduit is the press. In this model, the role of the press -- based on the Court 's need to maintain its power by maintaining public deference to its decisions -- is to cultivate a positive image of the Court. <p> The potential effect of the press in promoting the needs of the Court is enormous because the public generally knows little about the Court or its actions. Though a few major decisions may penetrate mass awareness through saturation media coverage, most do not. Sometimes even the groups most affected by decisions of the Court are unaware of them. For example, a mid-1970s survey of Florida high school teachers showed that only 17 percent were aware of the Engel v. Vitale decision, which disallowed school prayer.( n11) One prominent political researcher concluded : " Citizens, as individuals, evince little or no knowledge of or concern for the Court ; to the extent that they express sensible opinions, they base judgments on the vaguest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The justices recognize the importance of the press in disseminating the views of the Court to the public. Earl Warren acknowledged the relationship when he wrote that the issues handled by the Court should be " well understood and intelligently appraised by the public. Since the public can not be expected to read the opinions themselves, it must depend on newspapers, periodicals, radio, and television for its information. "( n13) In 1956, referring to a news clipping, Justice Harold H. Burton wrote to Warren, " This shows that the opinion is being understood and taken as it was intended to be taken -- at least by the writer of this editorial. "( n14) And in 1966 Earl Warren wrote to a reporter that he was " pleased beyond words " with the reporter 's coverage of the Miranda decision.( n15) <p> There is ample evidence that the justices pay close attention to the press not just when important decisions are at stake but on a regular basis -- with particular concern for how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ABC News, related a conversation with Justice Scalia in which Scalia made specific comments about his stories. Stuart Taylor, of American Lawyer magazine, received congratulatory personal notes from Justices Brennan, Powell, and O'Connor after writing profiles of them.( n16) <p> The justices also take an interest in negative stories. Chief Justice Burger once called news correspondent Fred Graham to his chambers to complain about a story Graham had done for the CBS Evening News.( n17) And Justice William O. Douglas wrote a scathing letter in response to a Washington Post story about the Court ; though he decided not to send it, it can be found in his papers. It reads in part : " It is amazing how little the press knows about Supreme Court procedures. A country paper that we read at Goose Prairie can be excused, but not the Washington Post, whose editors could find someone to give them a seminar on judicial procedure any time they choose. "( n18) Later, in his autobiography, Douglas called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their editorial pages as " a club by the publisher against the Court. "( n19) Douglas and Burger were not alone in their anger. A biographer of Justice Abe Fortas wrote that Fortas held a " hatred of the press, " and that he called reporters " dirty " and " crooked. "( n20) The attitudes of Burger, Fortas, and Douglas show that justices are quite concerned about how their efforts are covered. <p> Despite recognizing the press as a conveyer of their views and images to the public, the justices rarely acknowledge that the influence flows both ways. When asked in an interview what influence public opinion has on justices ' opinions, Justice William Brennan replied emphatically, " None. "( n21) Yet the justices at least notice the political world around them. Justice Scalia wrote in his concurring opinion in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services : <p> We can now look forward to at least another Term with carts full of mail from the public, and streets full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have been awarded those extraordinary, undemocratic characteristics precisely in order that we might follow the law despite the popular will -- to follow the popular will.( n22) <p> Whereas Scalia admitted to noticing expressions of public opinion, Chief Justice William Rehnquist more explicitly acknowledged its possible effect in a 1986 speech, before his elevation to chief justice : <p> Judges, so long as they are relatively normal human beings can no more escape being influenced by public opinion in the long run than can people working at other jobs. And if a judge on coming to the bench were to decide to hermetically seal himself off from all manifestations of public opinion, he would accomplish very little ; he would not be influenced by current public opinion, but instead by the state of public opinion at the time that he came onto the bench.( n23) <p> And one justice admitted in a background interview that public opinion may at least influence the Court 's agenda : " People just demand that the Supreme Court resolve an issue whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us sometimes. "( n24) <p> Though justices may deny acting with the press or the public in mind, their conduct suggests otherwise. The Court released its initial decision on the constitutional protection of flag burning during the week of Flag Day. Conveniently, the Court scheduled the oral arguments for, and delivered its decisions on, both the Webster and Casey abortion cases on the last days of their respective terms, thus minimizing the impact on the Court of public demonstrations and press reactions while it was still in session. <p> These anecdotal observations are bolstered by a systematic study by David G. Barnum, who concluded that the major Court actions of the 1960s on minority rights were prompted by public opinion and that the Court was unwilling to act in areas such as busing and legalization of homosexuality where their decisions would be antimajoritarian.( n25) <p> Though the Court must be responsive to public will to achieve deference to its decisions and maintain its power, it must not appear to be responsive to public opinion, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weaken its power. Thus a paradox exists for the justices ' conduct -- they must engage in image making while denying that they do so. They resolve the paradox by actively cultivating an image of aloofness. <p> An example of that self-conscious aloofness was related by Tony Mauro, a reporter for USA Today : <p> We had a reception at the press room for Justice Souter.... When a justice comes onto the court... we invite all the justices down for wine and cheese.... At the very end of it, Souter turned to us and said, " Well, thank you for this. I enjoyed it. Let 's do it again when I retire. " We realized as he walked away that you just do n't see them much. Once they get life tenure, they tend to get inaccessible -- until they 're old and they want to adjust their obituaries.( n26) <p> Other justices may not find such brush-offs so easy, but they too work on the image. Stuart Taylor made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most interesting of the justices because he is a ball of energy. He writes very forceful opinions. He does the same in oral argument. On the other hand, he does n't want to be a public figure, he 's very conscious of that. When he 's giving a speech, he does n't want to be televised. He does n't want anyone from the press to cover it. When he 's making a speech somewhere if he sees a television camera, he 'll go off stage and say " I 'm not going back on until that camera is gone. " The explanation he gives is that he does n't think Supreme Court justices should be public figures, out on the hustings making arguments. He ca n't resist doing it ; he just does n't want the image of what he 's doing widely disseminated. I think there was an element that some of the other justices felt he was getting a lot of attention, he was hotdogging too much and so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a certain tension between his urge to assert himself and his desire not to be perceived as asserting himself in certain ways.( 111) <p> In addition to cultivating respect through an image of aloofness, justices sometimes actively engage the press to accomplish other ends, such as protecting their personal images. Justices Harry Blackmun and William Rehnquist have granted interviews specifically to correct what they considered mistaken views of their personalities( 106). Other justices, for example William Brennan and Byron White, have punished the press by cutting off reporters when they felt they were treated unfairly ; however, after years of silence Brennan embraced the press near the end of his tenure, when his power on the Court was waning( 106-7). <p> A second reason that justices engage the press is to acquire external assistance in internal disputes. Justices sometimes use press interactions and public speeches to express their views to sympathetic audiences and criticize colleagues or other officials( 106-9). But the more common avenue for such expressions is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which serve no authoritative function within the legal system, are designed to gain attention for a particular justice 's view outside the Court. Dissents are much more likely to be reported than concurrences, probably because of the inherent drama of conflict.( n27) The number of such individual expressions by justices has increased over time. The Burger Court produced four times as many dissents and ten times as many concurrences as did the Hughes Court in the same amount of time. The extreme number of individual opinions in recent years caused David O'Brien to conclude that " individual opinions are more highly prized than the opinions of the Court. "( n28) <p> A third motive of the justices in press interactions is to affect the larger political environment as it touches the Court. They sometimes even participate in the public debate on nominees. Justice Stevens publicly endorsed the nomination of Robert Bork to the Court, and Justice Thurgood Marshall publicly questioned the nomination of David Souter because he had never heard of him.( n29) In 1986 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the press concerning original intent and judicial activism.( n30) <p> Thus the Court has an active but often subtle or hidden relationship with the press. That relationship is essential for individual justices in reaching personal objectives and for the Court as a whole in maintaining its power. To more fully understand the relationship it is helpful to examine the mechanics of reporting on the Supreme Court beat. COVERING THE COURT <p> Approximately fifty reporters are assigned to the Supreme Court. Twelve to fifteen work full time on the Court ; the rest cover other subjects as well. The Court beat is high in prestige because of its proximity to power but low in satisfaction because of the need to rely on documents and the paucity of interviews with sources.( n31) <p> Many journalists are general assignment reporters and move from beat to beat ; Supreme Court reporters are unique in their stability. In a survey of Court reporters half said they had been on the beat for more than six years.( n32) Longevity is an advantage at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accumulate expertise. <p> Another distinguishing characteristic of the Court beat is the legal background of many reporters. Some legal training is the norm among Court regulars, several of whom have law degrees. Legal training helps reporters to understand Court processes and communicate with legal experts as sources. <p> The sporadic nature of press coverage of the Court often relegates its reporters to the fringes of the journalistic community. " Face time " -- time on the air -- tends to be lower for broadcast reporters covering the Court than for other broadcast reporters. However, a few Court regulars, such as Nina Totenberg of National Public Radio, Tony Mauro of USA Today, Lyle Denniston of the Baltimore Sun, and Tim O'Brien of ABC News, have become media personalities, who deliver speeches about the Court and are even interviewed as experts on the Court. <p> At the beginning of each term reporters select from the Court 's " Order List "( cases accepted for oral argument in that term) a small number of newsworthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporters also read through the many requests for hearing, called certiorari petitions, to target key cases as early as possible. One reporter commented that " an increasing portion of my effort went into sifting through the Supreme Court docket in search of whiz-bang fact situations that might make it on the Court 's agenda. "( n33) <p> Television imposes additional limits on story choice and coverage. Tim O'Brien explained : " One of my stories, if it runs a minute-forty... that might be one column in a newspaper. Barely a column.... We ca n't be as comprehensive as you can in a newspaper simply because we do not have the time. "( n34) <p> Broadcast journalists present Court stories as human dramas. In covering a case about victim impact statements, Tim O'Brien traveled to Memphis to interview the family of a woman and her daughter who were stabbed to death. The late Toni House, public information officer for the Court, observed that " what television is able to do is put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to. They go out and put the people who were involved on camera. "( n35) <p> Wire service reporters work under even greater constraints because in most cases they file their stories first. One estimated that he spent three minutes reviewing a decision before filing the lead and thirty minutes before filing the whole story.( n36) Early wire stories shape the framing of stories by other reporters. Those cues become particularly important when a Court decision is complex and its implications may be unclear. <p> Reporters can cover a Supreme Court case at three stages : when the certiorari petition is submitted, when oral arguments are made, and when the decision is handed down. Oral arguments often provide the best opportunity to show conflict and introduce an issue, but as they lack finality and tend to be technical and dry, they can easily be neglected in anticipation of the decision. One reporter lamented : " Sometimes I come out of an oral argument with hardly a quotable quote. "( n37) Even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguments can help the reporter to understand the issues and may reveal the attitudes of justices, hinting at the coming decision. <p> When a decision is announced the Court 's public information office immediately distributes the opinions in printed form.( n38) At that point, reporters must read and begin to interpret the decision. <p> Interpretation is facilitated by extensive preparation. Court reporters spend the bulk of their time reading documents related to cases. Frank Aukofer of the Milwaukee Journal explained : <p> Most of the stuff that you need is right there at the Court-you have read the briefs, the amicus briefs. There is n't much need to go out and interview anybody. Sometimes to personalize it, to make a better story out of it, I will go out and talk to the people involved or talk to their lawyers. On a big case, when you have 20-30 amicus briefs, you pretty much get the gist of what 's going on from the documentation at the Court. It 's a nice, comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there right in front of you.( n39) <p> Because primary sources such as certiorari petitions and briefs are readily available to reporters, the decisions and the reasoning behind them are not usually a surprise for those who cover the Court.( n40) <p> Even with months of preparation, however, decision reading can be difficult. Carl Stern observed, " They 've got too many clerks, so they write these horrendously long law review articles for decisions.... The plain fact is that Supreme Court decisions today look like the periodic tables in chemistry. "( n41) New York Times reporter Linda Greenhouse wrote : " I see myself as a kind of translator. "( n42) In filling that role reporters need help, and they often rely on each other. <p> Supreme Court reporters operate in a competitive but collegial atmosphere. They compare notes after oral arguments and decisions.( n43) As Carl Stern explained : <p> You can not go to the principal actors and ask them what they meant. You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put our heads together and kind of ask each other, " What do you think it means? "... I ca n't think of any press operation that I 've experienced or did experience in almost thirty-four years of journalism that was as collegial as the Supreme Court press room.( 19,42) <p> One part-time Court reporter observed that the regulars are important to reporters like him because " once in a while you get a complex decision with no clear majority. Then I would talk it over with some of my colleagues who would have covered the case more closely. "( n44) <p> Another solution to the problem of interpretation, as the justices themselves refuse to clarify their written opinions, is to consult outside sources. Many interest groups happily volunteer to interpret decisions and their implications. Some, such as the ACLU, keep offices near the Court building for easy access to news conferences immediately after decisions. Others, such as the National Organization for Women, the Legal Defense Fund, and the Chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, area to inform reporters of their positions on upcoming cases. <p> Competition to serve as sources for Court stories is intense among interest groups. Their representatives mill about the Supreme Court plaza after decisions, hoping to share their spin with reporters. Elite reporters avoid the plaza and let the groups chase them. One reporter related that " people are falling all over themselves to offer you information, offering stories, offering access to major players. " Linda Greenhouse commented : " I do n't make too many phone calls. People call me "( 87). The most sought-after sources are more likely to return a call to an elite reporter. <p> Reporters also turn to academic experts. The Court reporters surveyed said legal experts were their most frequent source( 86). Pundits such as Lawrence Tribe and Arthur Miller, of Harvard Law School, are famous as sources, not only because they are experts but because they are quick to return calls and good at translating Court decisions into lay terms. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true particularly when one party is an interest group or the U.S. government. Another source is counsel in the case, who usually are willing to speak to the press. <p> Reporters keep lists of willing sources, categorized by issue. The choice of sources is often influenced by accessibility. One reporter admitted that his sources were " people you can get through to "( 86). Reporters often solicit strong rhetoric in an attempt to get a good quote. One news magazine reporter said, " I try to get a key quote to illuminate the issue -- a quote that is funny, or sexy, or unusual, or in a slightly offbeat way illuminates the case "( 90). Experts who best meet the sound bite imperative are the most likely to be used again. Thus stories about the Court often focus more on reactions to decisions than on the decisions themselves.( n45) <p> Two-thirds of the Court journalists surveyed said that their editor 's influence was important in their work.( n46) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories out first, they affect the approach of editors to their reporters ' stories.( n47) Editors rely on those reports to monitor their reporters ' story choices and use information from the wire in negotiating the length and angle of stories. If the approach of a non-elite reporter differs from that on the wire it is likely to be challenged by the editor, and the reporter will bear the burden of proof. <p> Editors exert control over the content of Court stories. Two-thirds of the reporters surveyed said that their editors want stories changed to better explain technical points. "( n48) Under editorial influence, many reporters omit much of the reasoning behind decisions because they consider it beyond their audience. Carl Stern found that approach frustrating : <p> Any words I used to describe the Court 's reasoning were rejected as beyond the understanding of the average Joe. Analogies were usually substituted from sports or warfare.... There 's many a time... that I took... if not a verbatim quote at least the essence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producer to change this or that. And I would say, " But that 's not what he said " and they would say, " well that 's what he really meant. " And I would say, " No, that 's not what he meant, and that 's not correct. " And then it came down to, " Do you want to get on the air tonight or do n't you want to get on the air tonight? "( n49) THE CONTENT OF COURT COVERAGE <p> Another wrinkle in the reporter 's job is the decreasing space and time devoted to Court stories. News organizations are forcing reporters to explain the Court with more brevity. Lyle Denniston, a long-time Supreme Court reporter for the Baltimore Sun, observed that in the mid-1980s he was given 28 to 30 inches of column space for a story, but by the mid-1990s he was receiving only 16 inches. The shrinkage of coverage has affected not only newspapers but television as well. Using data from the Vanderbilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time devoted to the Court had dropped from 3.9 percent to 2.4 percent over a five-year period. The Court received an average of 26 minutes per month in 1990-91 but only 8 minutes in 1994-95.( n50) <p> The decline in attention to the Court reflects the media 's emphasis on newsworthiness. Decisions that survive the filtering process must reflect news values.( n51) Only those that involve drama and conflict and seem proximate to the lives of viewers are covered. In Lyle Denniston 's words, a story is newsworthy if it is " an object of contemporary fascination. "( n52) Media critic James Fallows observed : " Get the ratings and you 're forgiven all else. The sin there is not being inaccurate. The sin is being boring. "( n53) Indeed, it can be argued that Court " proceedings are so dull that it is a public service to keep them off the tube. "( n54) <p> The Court itself may have contributed to the decline in interest. The Warren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desegregation, obscenity, and abortion, but the Rehnquist Court has been more restrained. Its restraint may be as much a matter of subject opportunity as of judicial choice. Lyle Denniston explained : <p> There is no such thing anymore... as a landmark precedent-setting decision like Brown or... Roe v. Wade. The salami is sliced thinner and thinner and thinner. In trying to cover a First Amendment case now you almost have to be a Talmudic scholar to slice the difference between the dogmatic principles the Court is going to follow.( n55) <p> Another factor that discourages press coverage is the justices ' aversion to personal stories. Stories about the Court are rarely about personalities, scandals, or the institution -- they are about the cases. In 1989-90, 74 percent of network Court stories were about cases on the current docket. By 1994 the figure had risen to 84 percent( 167). Exceptions to docket-centered coverage are resignations and confirmations of justices( 167-68). <p> The quest for newsworthiness produces a distorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Court dominated by social policy issues " to the exclusion of other types of cases. "( n56) Associated Press coverage during 1989-90 varied according to case content. First Amendment and civil rights cases were overreported in relation to their percentage of the docket ; cases involving judicial power, federalism, and the economy were underreported.( n57) <p> Furthermore, what coverage there is of Court decisions tends to be superficial. Slotnick and Segal found that only 26.7 percent of the stories about Webster referred to the fact that a Missouri law was being challenged, and that " a full 45 percent of Bakke stories Regents of University of California v. Bakke lacked specific content about the nature of Bakke 's claim or the factual scenario underlying it. "( n58) Slotnick and Segal concluded that reporting on the Webster and Bakke decisions was " relatively ahistorical and acontextual "( 104-5). <p> Glossing over the details is not the only shortcoming of Court reporting. Justices are rarely mentioned by name( 182). @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invisible in the coverage of Bakke and Webster( 154). A content analysis of Court stories spanning 1984 to 1989 revealed that only one-third of Time magazine stories and one-fifth of CBS stories mentioned a justice by name.( n59) Moreover, the justices ' votes in particular cases are rarely reported. Slotnick and Segal found that in 1989 the votes of the justices were reported by the networks in about half the cases. By 1994 such reports almost never occurred.( n60) In fact, interest groups were noted by name more often in Court stories than were the authors of Court opinions( 183-84). <p> A striking example of selectiveness and inaccuracy can be seen in the press coverage of certiorari petitions. In coding decisions for their 1989-90 study of network Court coverage, Slotnick and Segal found expansive coverage of merit decisions that they could not locate on the docket, and later they learned that those phantom decisions were actually certiorari denials( 197). Very few certiorari denials were reported by the networks in 1989 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were reported dealt with abortion, equal protection, and privacy( 201). In the 1989 term, 48.3 percent of reports about certiorari denial were mistakenly presented as merit decisions, 27.6 percent were presented ambiguously, and only 24.1 percent were reported accurately( 199). Court Public Information Officer Toni House said that the worst thing reporters do is to misrepresent certiorari denials, making them sound like decisions( 190). <p> In short, press coverage of the Court is minimal and superficial. Biases and mistakes in reporting present the public with a distorted view of the Court 's work. Given these realities, it is no wonder that the Court attempts to influence press coverage. THE INVISIBLE DANCE BETWEEN COURT AND PRESS <p> The Supreme Court justices lead the press in an invisible dance, restraining it with one hand while directing it with the other. Despite the lack of formal personal encounters, as in interviews and news conferences, justices and reporters interact regularly. <p> The justices shape press coverage by directing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their public appearances, by providing background information, by shutting off other points of access, and by avoiding issues of contention, focusing instead on minor matters such as working conditions. <p> Such efforts are not new. The Court began to institutionalize its relations with the press in the 1930s. In 1935 it opened a Public Information Office with a Court employee designated to help the press.( n61) In 1947 the Court appointed a full-time public information officer. The Court deliberately avoids terms such as " press secretary " or " press office. " Although the Public Information Office deals primarily with the press, the title implies that it simply gives information to the public, without acknowledging the press as the obvious conduit of that information. <p> In other branches of the federal government a press secretary provides advice on how policy will play with the public, but the Court 's public information officer does not so advise. Toni House said, " My job is peculiar in Washington because this office does n't spin, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our job is to put the news media together with the information that they need to cover the Court. "( n62) The Public Information Office provides official information, available to the general public as well as to the press, and nothing more, thus reinforcing the Court 's message that it is unconcerned with politics. Referring to crank calls and advocacy mail, House remarked, " People do n't realize we the Court do n't care what they think. "( n63) Former Time reporter Jerome Carter said that the Supreme Court is " the only beat in the federal government where if you ask them a question they stare at you and say, ' That 's your job. I 'm not here to do that. ' "( n64) <p> Despite these seeming barriers, as an institution the Court says a lot to the press -- in official documents. The number of certiorari petitions, Court orders, briefs, and opinions that a reporter is expected to know about is astounding. For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spent 50 percent of his time reading the four thousand certiorari petitions filed each year.( n65) By feeding the press an almost overwhelming volume of documents, the Court focuses press attention on the justices ' work product. Most news stories about the Court simply cover the content of the justices ' opinions.( n66) <p> But the justices realize that their written communications may not tell the whole story. Hence they interact with reporters in other settings. Regular reporters on the beat occasionally are granted off-the-record interviews. The justices prefer such settings, where they can direct the press without appearing to. They bind the press to maintain the perception that the justices do not interact -- as the price for the interaction. <p> They usually refuse to discuss current cases, and reporters know better than to ask. But the justices do discuss their roles in past decisions and offer insight on the Court 's inner machinations. Only three of the Court journalists surveyed said that they had never had an off-the-record interview with a justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justices ; two reported such interviews with every current justice. Two-thirds said they had been granted off-the-record interviews in every term.( n67) <p> The justices both provide information and limit it. The clerks who serve the justices each term are potentially valuable news sources because they are privy to the Court 's handling of current cases. However, the justices prevent leaks. Clerks are warned not to talk to reporters and are teased about the " twenty-second rule " -- that if they talk to a reporter they will be fired within twenty seconds.( n68) <p> Even when leaks occur, the justices can discredit them by simply altering their plans. Tim O'Brien remarked that the Court can " make you look foolish if you say decision on such and such day.... The Court does n't like it when someone announces their decision before they do. "( n69) Because the Court eventually goes public with its decisions, some reporters say it is not worth the risk of reporting a leak that might be wrong or that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough at plugging leaks that reporters do not expect them. Without reliable alternative sources, reporters simply wait for the Court to speak -- through its written opinions. <p> The extent to which the justices care about Court press is evident in their efforts to facilitate accurate coverage. In addition to providing a press room and issuing opinions promptly, and other measures designed to accommodate the press, they sometimes alter their procedures to help reporters get the story right. For example, when Carl Stem told Chief Justice Burger that he had misreported a decision on the air( thinking it had been the reverse decision), Burger ordered that clarifying headnotes be attached to the decision.( n70) The Court changed its former policy of not announcing scheduled decision days after reporters complained that they did not know when to come to the Court to hear decisions. The announcements still do not indicate which decisions will be released.( n71) The Court also changed its policy of delivering all opinions on Mondays, after lobbying from reporters to spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred when the Court realized that too many decisions were going unreported because of its unpredictable schedule and excessive volume on a single day. <p> Although the Court has occasionally made changes to assist the press, the changes have always been designed so that the Court benefits in more accurate and more extensive press coverage of its written work. Future changes will surely be of the same character, or they will not be instituted by the Court. <p> Reporters ' responses to the Court 's handling of the press vary. Some reporters chafe at the procedures ; others support them. One reporter defended the tactics of the Court by saying : <p> It 's the one institution set up to defend minority rights. It 's the only one that really depends totally on popular will. It does n't have the power of the purse strings ; it has no army. To demystify it, to start covering the bickerings of the justices in their private meetings -- it might lower the Court 's esteem in the eyes of the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support, then it wo n't remain an institution very long, even though it 's provided for in the Constitution. <p> So I 'm not all that upset with the way it operates. I 'm almost in agreement with them that it should n't be televised. I 'd love to sit in on a Friday afternoon conference, or I 'd love to be able to buttonhole the justices in the hall and find out who 's sticking it to who. I 'd love to do those kinds of stories. But I 'm not sure it would be so good for the institution.( n73) OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE RESEARCH <p> Many facets of the interaction between justices and reporters remain unexplored by scholars. Particularly scarce are studies on justices ' motives for interacting with reporters, even in background interviews. Why do justices go public at times and not at other times? <p> A historical analysis is needed to help us understand whether Court-press interactions have increased over time, under what circumstances they are likely to occur, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such interactions weaken the Court by exposing the justices to press notice, or do they strengthen the Court by enhancing public understanding and appreciation of that unique institution? We have determined that the Court and the press are engaged in a dance. But we could learn much more about how they dance and why. <p>
