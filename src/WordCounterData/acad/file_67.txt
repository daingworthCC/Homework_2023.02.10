4010341 This study examined the utilization of counseling services by international students at a major university in Texas. Five hundred and sixteen international students visited the university counseling center during the academic years of 1992 and 1998. Their demographic characteristics, referral resources, types of services sought, as well as their self reported presenting concerns, were examined. Those students who used the counseling center for career counseling were more likely to be younger, female, and of undergraduate status. Those students who used the counseling center for personal problems were more likely to be older, male, and graduate students. " Academics/Grades, " " Anxiety, " and " Depression " were the top three concerns for undergraduate students while " Depression, " " Time Management, " and " Relationship with Romantic Partner " were the top three " extremely worried " concerns for graduate students. Culturally responsive programming, implications for counseling, limitations of this study, and suggestions for future study are discussed. <p> Between the 1999-2000 and 2000-2001 academic years, the number of international students attending colleges and universities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 547,867( Institute for International Education, 2002). The Open Doors Report on International Exchange published by the Higher Education Resources Group, a division of the Institute of International Education, provides annual statistical data on students coming to the United States, as well as U.S. students studying abroad. According to this report, the 6.4% increase in international enrollment in U.S. colleges and universities is the largest increase in the past twenty years. While the impact of the September 11 tragedy on international ex change is yet to be empirically examined, the expectation is that the number of international students in the U.S. will continue to increase in the future( Lin &; Yi, 1997 ; Mori, 2000 ; Sandhu &; Asrabadi, 1994). University personnel and mental health professionals face the challenge of providing appropriate counseling services to this large and growing population. It is important to examine international students ' unique experiences and concerns, including the impact of terrorism and anti-terror policies on these students. A better understanding of the issues of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foster an environment more conducive to direct interaction between students of different cultures.( Lin &; Yi, 1997 ; Mori, 2000 ; Sandhu &; Asrabadi, 1994). <p> Over the years, many studies have examined international students ' counseling concerns and needs. These concerns and needs can be broadly divided into five interrelated categories : academic, physical health, financial, vocational, and personal/social. Academically, international students straggle with completing essay examinations, taking notes during lectures due to limited language proficiency( Deressa &; Beavers, 1988 ; Parr, Bradley &; Bingi, 1992), and the difficulties of studying effectively in a new educational system( Mau &; Jepsen, 1990). Second, concerning physical health, many international students indicate that they have difficulty interacting with U.S. healthcare providers due to language barriers or a lack of knowledge of the healthcare system( Prieto, 1995). Third, some international students face financial hardships during the years of their study due to immigration regulations that generally prohibit international students from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, international students ' unique vocational concerns/needs are related to the geographic location of their future employment. Upon the completion of their studies, it is difficult for them to decide whether to seek employment in the U.S. or in their countries of origin( Wehrly, 1986). Lastly, the most commonly reported personal/social concerns of international students involve social isolation, loneliness, homesickness, irritability, and tiredness( Das, Chow &; Rutherford, 1986 ; Wehrly, 1986). For example, one study suggests that international students ' psychological distress is related to a profound sense of loss, a sense of inferiority, a sense of uncertainty, communication problems, culture shock, and the loss of the social support systems they had in their countries of origin( Sandhu, 1995). Such concerns can lead to life-disrupting stress. <p> Another area that previous studies have focused on is the help-seeking behaviors of international students. One study states that international and U.S. students frequently list parents, older friends, and student friends as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1986). Although one of the potentially significant sources of support for international students is mental health professionals, research suggests that international students generally do not seek services from counseling centers on campus( Mau et al., 1990). For example, due to the stigma of mental health, many students from Asian countries do not seek professional psycho logical help unless they have exhausted their support system. Thus, they are likely to be in subjective crisis when they do reach out to the counselors( Lin, 1996). <p> Although previous studies provided useful insights into the needs, concerns and behaviors of international students, several aspects still remain unexamined. To better understand the complexity of their experiences and differences related to their country of origin, there is a need to focus on subgroup differences among international students. In addition, although prior studies emphasized the need of university personnel and counselors to be proactive in providing emotional support for international students( Angelopoulos &; Catano, 1993 ; Sandhu, 1995), few culturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actively encourage international students ' use of mental health professionals have been published( Lin, 2000). <p> The purpose of this study was to examine the utilization of counseling services by international students at a major university in Texas. We wish to understand who seeks counseling, how they go about doing so, and why they sought it. We examined the demographic characteristics and subgroup differences of the international students( who), their referral resources( how), types of services sought, and their self-reported concerns( why). Utilization is defined as " a help-seeking behavior in which the services of the mental health system are used "( Sue, Zane, &; Young, 1994). This study examined several significant elements. First, we contribute to the limited knowledge about international students ' utilization of counseling services by focusing on the international students ' help-seeking behaviors. Secondly, a description of international students can provide useful background information for counselors to develop culturally-responsive programs that operate within the existing values of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a basis for evaluating existing counseling programs and assisting the development and implementation of new programs to meet the needs of international students. Method <p> This study examined the existing data of self-identified international students who visited the counseling center at a major university in Texas over a six-year period( 1992-1998). A total of 562 international students visited the counseling center during the six years. Included in this sample were 46 international students who came to the institution to attend language classes. Although counseling services were available for them, international students were not enrolled as regular admissions status students at this university. Hence, they were excluded from analysis. The international students were asked to complete questionnaires before their counseling appointments. The questionnaires were developed by the counseling center. Questionnaire items were designed to collect information on demographic factors, referral sources, reasons for seeking counseling, and self-reported problems and concerns. The SPSS statistical analysis system( version 10.0) was used to analyze the data. Tests of group differences were based on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county of origin, living status, marital status) and on the t test and analysis of variance for continuous variables( e.g., age, GPA). Results <p> Table I summarizes selected characteristics of the study participants. Asian students comprised over one-half( 59%) of all international students who used the counseling center. They were followed by students from Central and South America( 24.1%), and Europe( 10.2%). Of the Asian countries, China was the leading place of origin for international students( n=65), followed by India( n=54), Japan( n=51), Taiwan( n=27), and Korea( n=21). More than one half( 56.6%) of the samples were undergraduate students. The mean GPA among students was 2.8, with the range being from 0.8 to 4.0. The mean age of the students was 23.9 years old, with ages ranging from 17 to 53 years. In general, undergraduate students were more likely to be younger and have a lower GPA than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M=2.6, SD=0.62) of the undergraduate students was significantly( p<0.01, t=-7.534) lower than the mean GPA( M=3.1, SD=0.61) of the graduate students. As expected, undergraduate students( M=20.0, SD=5.31) were significantly( p<0.01, t=-10.865) younger than graduate students( M=28.4, SD= 6.75). Among all the participants, less than one-third( 27.5%) of students lived in on-campus housing. Those students living on campus( M=3.0, SD= 0.76) had a significantly( p=0.005, t=-2.826) higher GPA than those living off campus( M=2.7, SD=0.62). Those students living on campus( M=21.6, SD=8.1) were also significantly( p=0.03, t=2.243) younger than those living off campus( M=24.6, SD=6.5). <p> For the variable representing reasons for visit, respondents were classified into three groups : " academic "( n=99 ; 22.0%), " career "( n=40 ; 8.9%), and " personal "( n=233 ; 51.8%). About 13% of students reported using counseling services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gender, age, and GPA were significantly relined to reasons for visits. Of those who sought career counseling, more than one-half( 62.5%) were female students. Those students who sought career counseling services were significantly( p=0.008, F=4.851) younger than those who needed academic counseling. For example, the mean age( M=21.3, SD=-4.82) of the students seeking career counseling services was less than the mean age of those students seeking academic( M=23.3, SD=8.3) or personal( M=24.8, SD=7.0) counseling. There was a significant( X=15.236, df( 3), p=0.002)) difference between class and reasons for visit. Of those who sought career counseling, more than two-thirds( 81.6%) were undergraduate students compare to less than one-fifth( 18.4%) being graduate students. The mean GPA( M=2.7, SD=0.65) of the students seeking academic counseling services was lower than the mean GPA of those students seeking career( M=3.0, SD=-0.60) or personal( M=3.0, SD=0.65) counseling. Of those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were male students compared to 37.3% being female students. <p> For the variable representing how students were referred to counseling services, respondents were classified into four groups : " Advisor/staff "( n=102 ; 22.1%), " Friends/ Relatives "( n=60 ; 13%), " Self "( n=266 ; 57.6%), and " Faculty "( n=25 ; 5.4%). The majority( 57.6%) of students were self-referred to the counseling center. Only 17.8% of students heard about the counseling center from campus advertisements( e.g., flyers, the web). The mean GPA of international students who were referred by faculty/advisor/staff( M=2.7, SD=0.7) was lower than that of those referred by friends/ relatives( M=3.0, SD=0.7) or by self( M=3.1, SD=0.6). Undergraduate students were more likely to be referred by faculty/advisor/staff than graduate students. Nearly 70% of the undergraduate students reported that they were referred by faculty/advisor/staff com pared to 32.4% of graduate students. <p> In general, those students who used the counseling center for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and of undergraduate status. Those students who used the counseling center for personal problems were more likely to be older, male, and graduate students. The relationships between referral sources and gender and age were not significant. There was no significant relationship between country of origin( Asia/ South and Central America/Other countries) and reasons for visit, referral sources, or how they heard about the counseling center. <p> Table 2 summarizes the top ten problems students said they were " extremely worried " about. The table is divided into " All Students, " " Undergraduate Students " and " Graduate Students. " " Academics/ Course Work Grades " was the most common concern for both the undergraduate and graduate students. A majority( 82%) reported that they were " extremely worried " or " worried " about their academic-related problems. " Academics/Grades, " " Anxiety, " and " Depression " were the top three concerns for undergraduate students while " Depression, " " Time Management, " and " Relationship with Romantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns for graduate students. <p> Combining the " extremely worried " and " worried " self-reported problems/issues, international students in this study reported that they were " extremely worried/worded " about " Anxiety/Fear/Nervousness "( 82.7%), " Depression "( 74.2%), " Self-esteem "( 70.1%), " Confusion about beliefs/values future life "( 69.5%), and " Loneliness "( 62.3%). " Academic/course work grades " was a " worry " of 82.0% of students. Nearly one half of students reported that they were " worded/extremely worried " about " Employment after graduation "( 47.1%). Discussion <p> The results of this study are consistent with the literature in areas of international students ' concerns. " Academics/Course work grades, " " depression, " and " anxiety " were the major concerns of the international students in this study. Furthermore, undergraduate students worried about their academic grades more than graduate students. Literature suggested that English proficiencies could play an important role in the academic problems of international students. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undergraduate students, and it is possible that undergraduate students have more difficulties with English than graduate students. <p> While both groups( undergraduates and graduates) had relationship concerns such as breakup/loss of relationship, graduate international students were more likely to report relationship problems with their romantic partners. It should be noted that graduate students are more likely to be married and that their spouses are unable to work due to immigration regulation. Their spouses tended to stay at home with their younger children. While there is an increasing awareness of the needs of international students in counseling programs( Lin and Yi, 1997), more attention should be paid to programs for international students ' spouses and families. <p> We did not examine the causes of the students ' expressed concerns and problems. However, one can speculate that reported concerns such as academic and relationship difficulties, confusion about the future, feelings of loneliness, and low self-esteem could contribute to anxiety and depression. Thus, it is important for academic and career counselors to assess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presenting concerns may not be personal issues. For many international students, it might be more culturally acceptable to seek help in improving their grades or choosing an esteemed career than to seek personal counseling for anxiety or depression. <p> Nearly 70% of international students in the study reported that they were extremely worried or worried about their future lives. Future studies need to explore why they are confused about their future lives. For example, are they worried about where they should work? Are they having difficulties making career decisions because they must strike a balance between what they want to do and the expectations of their family? <p> The study provided baseline information on the needs and concerns identified by international students. This information could address current gaps in the literature on providing culturally-specific proactive programming for international students. For example, stress management or time management workshops focusing on how to balance home life and school or how to have healthy relationships could be helpful. It will be important to educate international students about the symptoms of anxiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counseling centers may also educate students on helpful resources and when and how to seek help. <p> This study showed that more than half of the students were self-referred to the counseling center. Previously, it was believed that due to the stigma of mental problems, international students are not likely to refer themselves for psychological help( Lin, 1996). Although many of these students did use the personal counseling services, the personal counseling services in this institution offered a culturally specific psycho-educational group. In the year that this group was implemented, 46% of the international students who came to the counseling center attended that counseling group( Lin and Roberts, 1999). Thus, whether students would refer themselves to seek psychological help remains a research question. <p> It is important to note that special efforts were made at this institution to help international students be more aware of the counseling services. For example, the counseling center hired a counselor who had expertise with international students to coordinate international student counseling programs and services. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition, the counselor served as a mentor to international students and an advisor to international student organizations. The counselor also served as a liaison to both the campus community and the local community of the international students. Reaching out to the community may have increased the students ' awareness of the counseling services and may have also helped to build up the credibility of the counseling center( Lin, 2000). Future studies should examine how many international students self-refer for personal counseling at a university that does not offer culturally responsive outreach or programs. There is a lack of literature offering concrete ways for institutions to increase utilization of counseling centers by international students. Although many researchers point to the need for university personnel and counselors to be proactive in providing emotional support for international students( Angelopoulos &; Catano, 1993), little has been published on specific ways institutions can actively encourage international students to utilize university counseling centers. This study suggests the need to devise effective marketing strategies for counseling center services. The findings from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketing programs for the promotion of counseling centers. Only 17.8% of the participants heard about the counseling center through campus advertisements( flyers, web, etc.). Future studies should explore what medium is especially attractive for international students as a source of information and identify culturally appropriate outreach strategies for international students. <p> Several limitations to this study should be addressed. First, the data analysis of the current study was based on the counseling center 's archival data. More specifically, the information was initially gathered by the university counseling center for counseling intervention purposes. The researchers did not have direct access to the participants in this study during the data collection or analysis stage. The researchers, therefore, could not ask the students to clarify or elaborate on particular items of interest. If the researchers had access to the students, more detailed information regarding the students ' counseling center use could have been obtained. <p> Even though the present research can be added to the current knowledge of international students ' utilization of counseling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students in the United States. Two characteristics in particular limit the external validity of the results. First, the data was collected from international students who visited the counseling center for services. Since some studies suggest that international students generally hesitate to seek psychological services( Prieto, 1995), it is possible that the participants under-represent the international student population nationwide. Thus, the data presented in this study may not apply to international students who do not seek professional support from the counseling center. Second, the unique characteristics of the university at which the data was obtained may interfere with the reliability and validity of this study. The university is located in a small town in the southern part of the U.S. and is historically known for its educational emphasis on agriculture and engineering. It is possible that students with different majors are likely to possess different personality traits that may affect their help-seeking behaviors. Although not all participants in this study were agriculture or engineering majors, the results can not be generalized to international students at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to the reasons for visiting the counseling center, the analysis was based on responses given by the students when they first visited the counseling center. The students provided the responses prior to establishing rapport and trust with the center. It is possible, therefore, that the responses were influenced by social acceptability and cautious attitudes on the students ' part( Murphy &; Dillon 1998). For example, a student who was depressed may have indicated on the initial intake form that he or she seeks services for vocational purposes, a more socially acceptable response. In other words, it is possible that a discrepancy exists between the students ' stated purpose of visit and the actual focus of the counseling work. <p> The current study leaves topics to be further explored in future studies. First, in order to identify international students who may require extra guidance and encouragement to nudge them into utilizing counseling services, future studies need to examine attitudes and characteristics of students who have not sought counseling services but are in need of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the factors that cause the possible discrepancy between stated purpose and actual focus of counseling, the students ' acculturation levels, and the levels of English fluency to further understand the stigma associated with seeking psychological counseling services and attitudes toward help-seeking. Third, the therapeutic alliances, the difficulties encountered during counseling such as language and cultural barriers between counselors and clients, counselor characteristics, and perceived helpfulness could be other interesting areas of investigation. Finally, there is also a need to examine the long-term developmental changes of the needs and help-seeking attitudes of international students( Prieto, 1995). Anew way to assess these developmental changes needs to be developed. <p> To conclude, this study contributes to the current knowledge of the international students ' utilization of counseling services, their demographic characteristics, their concerns, referral resources, and the types of services sought. Culturally responsive counseling services should be intentional, flexible and accessible, and counseling centers should examine their service delivery systems to ensure that their programs meet these requirements. Counseling centers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorporate student and community leaders in the programming and the evaluation of counseling services. By examining a few years of counseling data concerning international students at a major Texas university, this study contributes to our understanding oft he unique counseling needs of international students. Counsel ors can use this knowledge to design culturally appropriate counseling services and programs, which could lead to increased utilization of counseling services. Finally, with increasing internationalization and globalization and the post-9/11 rise of tensions toward international students, counselors should pay close attention to the increasing needs of the international student community and take on multiple helping roles to reach out to the community.
