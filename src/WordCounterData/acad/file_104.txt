4015141 Section : Articles Introduction <p> Background : Rotavirus infection is thought to be confined to the intestine. Reports of rotavirus RNA in the cerebral spinal fluid and serum of children infected with rotavirus suggest the possibility that rotavirus escapes the intestine into the circulatory system. We assessed whether rotavirus antigen, RNA, or both, were present in serum samples from immunocompetent rotavirus-infected children and animals. <p> Methods : We obtained sera from immunocompetent mice, rats, rabbits, and calves 1-10 days after inoculation with rotavirus or matched vehicle. We obtained sera retrospectively from immunocompetent children diagnosed with rotavirus diarrhoea( n=33), healthy children( n=6) and adults( n=12), children convalescing from rotavirus( n=6), and children with non-rotavirus diarrhoea( n=11). Samples were analysed for the presence of rotavirus antigen or RNA by EIA or RT-PCR, respectively. <p> Findings : Rotavirus antigen was present in sera from rotavirus-infected animals, but not in sera from control animals. Infectious rotavirus or rotavirus RNA was detected in sera of mice and calves, respectively. Antigen was present in 22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in none of 35 samples from controls. Detection of serum antigen was inversely related to the number of days between symptom onset and sample collection, and directly related to stool antigen concentration. Rotavirus RNA was detected by RT-PCR in three of six rotavirus-positive sera. <p> Interpretation : Rotavirus can escape the gastrointestinal tract in children, resulting in antigenaemia and possible viraemia. This finding is important for the understanding of the pathogenesis, immunology, and clinical manifestations of rotavirus infection. <p> Rotavirus is a common pathogen that is the leading cause of gastroenteritis in young children worldwide. 1 Dehydration due to rotavirus-induced diarrhoea and vomiting results in high mortality rates in developing countries and a large economic burden in developed countries. 1 Rotavirus infection is thought to be localised to the gastrointestinal tract. However, there have been reports of rotavirus RNA in cerebral spinal fluid and serum of rotavirus-infected children. 2-7 Rotavirus non-structural proteins have also been reported in liver and kidney sections from rotavirus-infected immunocompromised children, suggesting that extraintestinal spread of rotavirus can occur during infection. 8 Work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotavirus infection is not contained within the gastrointestinal tract. 9, 10 These findings suggest the possibility that rotavirus escapes the intestine into the circulatory system. We assessed whether rotavirus antigen can be identified in sera from immunocompetent, rotavirus-infected children and animals, with the aim of better understanding the pathogenesis of rotavirus infection. Methods <p> Immunocompetent suckling and adult mice, suckling rats, adult rabbits, and newborn colostrum-deprived calves were gastrically inoculated with rotaviruses derived from homologous or heterologous species( table) or with matched vehicle. Stool and serum samples were obtained 1-10 days after inoculation. Care was taken to ensure that serum samples were not contaminated with rotavirus from stools by using gloves and sterile supplies, and disinfecting and swabbing the site with ethanol during cardiac puncture( mouse), ear bleed( rabbit), tail bleed( rat), and jugular vein puncture( cow). Stool and serum samples were analysed with Pathfinder Rotavirus EIA( BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) or in-house EIAs. 11 Three cow serum samples were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VP7 outer capsid protein) by use of consensus primers. 12 RNA was extracted using trizol( Life Technologies, Frederick, MD, USA) and negative controls( water run through every four to five serum samples) were included to detect contamination. <p> To test whether infectious virus was present in serum( ie, could pass from the gastrointestinal tract into the blood), we inoculated 28 rotavirus-naive adult mice each with 100 mL of serum : 11 with sera from 11 rotavirus-infected adult mice ; three with sera from three different pools of rotavirus-infected infant mice serum ; 11 controls with sera from 11 adult mice inoculated with vehicle ; and three controls with pooled sera from three non-infected infant mice. Rotavirus infection was established by the excretion of high concentrations of faecal antigen( measured by EIA). Samples from these animal models were assessed 4 days after viral inoculation. <p> Human serum samples were obtained retrospectively from Texas Children 's Hospital( TCH) in Houston, TX, USA( five children) and Royal Children 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children). All serum samples were obtained from immunocompetent children, aged 1-36 months, presenting with acute gastroenteritis confirmed by EIA( Rotazyme, Abbot Laboratories TCH and in-house serotyping RCH) 13 of a 10% weight-for-volume stool sample to be rotavirus positive. Inclusion in the study was dependent on sufficient serum remaining from a blood sample. At RCH, samples were obtained within 7 days of onset of symptoms. Convalescent sera were also obtained from six of the rotavirus-positive children at RCH when they were asymptomatic, which was 29-42 days from presentation with rotavirus gastroenteritis. Control sera were obtained from :( 1) six healthy children( aged 2-21 months) at RCH whose stool samples were rotavirus-antigen negative by EIA ;( 2) 12 adult volunteers associated with the Enteric Virus Research Group, RCH ;( 3) a child at TCH who was rotavirus-stool negative by EIA and electronmicroscopy and who presented with acute gastroenteritis due to a Norwalk virus infection confirmed by RT-PCR ;( 4) and ten children( aged 6-24 months) who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with non-rotavirus pathogens( eg, Salmonella spp, adenoviruses, and astrovirus). The study was approved by the institutional review boards of TCH and RCH. At TCH, parental informed consent was oral( by telephone) ; at RCH written consent was obtained. <p> Rotavirus antigen was detected in undiluted serum( 50 mL) by in-house EIA. 11, 13 Rotavirus RNA was detected by RT-PCR 14 with consensus primers for full-length VP7 genomic sequence after isolation of RNA by use of the Qiagen Qiaamp minelute virus spin kit( Valencia, CA, USA). <p> Groups were compared using Student 's t test or Wilcoxon two-sample test. <p> Role of the funding source : <p> The funding sources for this research had no role in study design ; in the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data ; in the writing of the report ; or in the decision to submit the paper for publication. Results <p> All serum and stool samples from rotavirus-inoculated animals were positive for rotavirus antigen by EIA 1-10 days after viral inoculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with rhesus rotavirus( table). All serum and stool samples were negative for rotavirus by EIA in vehicle-inoculated suckling mice( n=3, pooled samples from four individual animals), adult mice( n=18), calves( n=3), suckling rats( n=3), and adult rabbits( n=4)( data not shown). <p> The table shows results from rotavirus-inoculated animals on day 4 after inoculation. RT-PCR was done prospectively on serum samples from one, and retrospectively from two, EIA-rotavirus-positive newborn calves ; all three were positive for rotavirus RNA, suggesting that some or all of the antigen detected was derived from intact rotavirus virions. <p> Nine of the 11 mice( 82% 95% CI 48-98) inoculated with sera from rotavirus-infected adult mice and all three mice inoculated from rotavirus-infected infant mice( table) became infected with rotavirus. Inoculation of mice with EIA-antigen-negative sera did not result in infection( data not shown). <p> Sera from rotavirus-negative adult volunteers( n=12 ; data not shown), healthy children( n=6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( n=11 ; figure 1) were rotavirus-antigen negative. 22 of 33 children( 67% 48-82) with rotavirus-positive stool samples had detectable( median optical density OD 0.863) serum rotavirus antigen( table and figure 1).

We do not provide formal proof that rotavirus present in serum samples from infected children is infectious. However, animal data from this and other studies suggests that rotavirus antigen detected in serum of rotavirus-infected mice is infectious even in the presence of serum factors that might inhibit infectivity( table). 15 Direct proof of infectious particles in serum from children was not possible since no small animal models are proven to be susceptible to infections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest that viraemia seems likely in children and could account for the association of rotavirus infection with extraintestinal clinical manifestations. <p> Previous reports of the extraintestinal presence of rotavirus in children and infants have been much debated. Most of these studies included only small numbers of children. Much scepticism has surrounded the RT-PCR detection of rotavirus RNA in cerebral spinal fluid, arising from the concern that these results could result from stool rotavirus contamination during lumbar-puncture sample collection. 2-7 However, many symptoms that would be consistent with the extraintestinal spread of rotavirus have been reported in case studies of rotavirus-infected children during the past 20 years : pneumonia, 17 exanthema, 17 disseminated intravascular coagulation, 18 haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, 19 and neurological complications such as encephalitis or encephalopathy, 3, 5, 19, 20 cerebellitis, 21 or convulsions or seizures. 2, 4-6 With no proof of extraintestinal spread, these findings remain only associations, and although they suggest that rotavirus might be related to these symptoms, there is no direct proof that rotavirus infection causes symptoms other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been only a few reports of the detection of rotavirus RNA in blood or other components of the circulatory system in children. Morrison and colleagues 22 used in-situ RT-PCR to analyse the tissues involved in fatal rotavirus infections in two children, and noted viral RNA in the heart and CNS, mainly localised to endothelial cells. Ushijima and colleagues 7 and Nishimura and colleagues 2 found rotavirus RNA using RT-PCR in two of seven serum samples from children with rotavirus diarrhoea. 2, 7 Our findings( three of six serum samples from rotavirus-infected children positive for rotavirus RNA) are consistent with theirs and support the notion that intact rotavirus virions are present in serum during rotavirus infection. However, the design and sensitivity of RT-PCR approaches do not rule out possible stool rotavirus contamination of the serum samples. Because our sample size was small, definitive conclusions about the percentage of samples with rotavirus RNA can not be drawn from these data. However, based on results by Gouvea and colleagues, 14 RT-PCR detection of rotavirus doublestranded RNA has comparable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sensitivity of our EIA( 10 4 particles) 11 is about one log 10 lower than RT-PCR( 10 5 particles), which accounts for the detection of RNA in only 50% of the antigen-positive serum samples. Other reasons for the inability to detect viral RNA in all samples could be virus breakdown in serum resulting from repeated freezing and thawing( a difficulty mentioned by the manufacturers of the RNA extraction kit), or the presence of PCR inhibitors in serum. <p> Findings of rotavirus antigens in conjunction with rotavirus RNA in serum would have lent more credence to the presence of rotavirus viraemia. Previous reports have not noted rotavirus antigens in serum in conjunction with rotavirus RNA. Saulsbury and colleagues 23 did not detect rotavirus antigen using enzyme-linked fluorescent assay in 14 immunocompetent children admitted to hospital with rotavirus infection. However, three of four rotavirus-infected immunocompromised children did have rotavirus antigen in the blood. 23 Rotavirus proteins have also been detected by immunohistochemical techniques in immunocompromised children with rotavirus infections in extraintestinal sites such as the liver and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immunocompetent children with fatal rotavirus infections. 8, 22 The findings of Saulsbury and colleagues contrast with our findings that 22 of 33 immunocompetent children acutely infected with rotavirus infection had detectable rotavirus antigen in serum in the first few days after disease onset. Our results, and the fact that we did not detect rotavirus antigen in convalescent serum, serum from healthy children or adult volunteers, or serum from children with non-rotavirus-associated acute gastroenteritis, show the specificity of the EIA that we used. Differences in sensitivities between Saulsbury and colleagues 1 and our diagnostic approach could, in part, account for the differing results. We have shown that stool antigen concentrations and the number of days between onset of diarrhoea and serum collection affect the ability to detect serum antigen. Thus, the timing of sample collection could have adversely affected Saulsbury and colleagues 1 results. Additionally, rotavirus-specific antibodies or other factors in serum could have hindered detection of rotavirus antigen in serum in both studies. <p> Our work raises the question of how rotavirus escapes the intestine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family that contains rotavirus, use transepithelial transport through M cells. These cells are a specialisation of the mucosal epithelium that overlies the Peyer 1s patches, which act as conduits to the immune, lymphatic, and circulatory systems. 24 Rotavirus antigens have been detected in M cells, and these cells could provide rotavirus with access to the bloodstream. <p> Further investigations are needed to establish the importance of our findings in understanding rotavirus pathogenesis, the relation between extraintestinal spread and the severity of disease and tissue damage, the role of viraemia in the immune response, and induction of protective immunity against reinfection. In light of our findings, further studies are needed to reassess the frequency and importance of extraintestinal symptoms associated with rotavirus infection. <p> Contributors : <p> S E Blutt designed and coordinated the study, collected data, and wrote the manuscript.
