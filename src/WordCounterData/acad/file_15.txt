4002441 Educating a first generation of citizens to take their place in a democratic society is as essential today as it was over 200 years ago. Just as teachers in our world 's emerging democracies are trying to ready new generations for a democratic life, so were America 's first educators concerned with a similar task. Teachers in today 's Russia or Kyrghizstan accept the importance of the school and its curriculum as crucial to the development of a child 's democratic attitude( Wile 2000). America 's first educators made the same assumptions. <p> Constructing the first modern democracy in history, American educators were pioneers in the business of educating democratic citizens. Rejecting what they considered as the autocratic and irrelevant knowledge of a traditional European education, many looked to more practical skills and knowledge necessary for a citizen 's activist democratic role. To accomplish that task, they needed a new curriculum. <p> In this article, I show how a curriculum similar to the Expanding Environments curriculum was an important key to citizenship education in America 's first schools. The Expanding Environments theory, attributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, suggests that teachers begin the sequence of social studies -- citizenship education -- by introducing the more personal and current concepts of self and community in the early grades and by expanding to the less personal and distant concepts of nation and world in the higher grades. Although no one knows exactly when this curriculum theory emerged, Hanna 's influential 1962 article connects his name to the idea. <p> Advocates of this curriculum theory, however, do exist earlier in America 's educational history. Early twentieth century educators like John Dewey and Lucy Sprague Mitchell( 1878-1967) argued that it was necessary to connect students to their world by having them look at their familiar surroundings. Dewey( 1929) claimed that memorization of disconnected facts actually harms young children. He wrote, " The school must represent present life-life as real and vital to the child as that which he carries on in the home, in the neighborhood, or in the playground.... Much of present education fails because it neglects the fundamental principle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19). <p> Influenced by Dewey 's work, Lucy Sprague Mitchell built on Dewey 's principle by emphasizing the " here and now " through her " curriculum of experience "( Antler 1987). Applying her theories to female college students in the first decades of the twentieth century, Mitchell, as dean of women at the University of California, enhanced what she viewed as a limited higher education for women by encouraging a first-hand, discovery approach. She developed the curriculum theory from her own personal learning style and attributed its success to two components : a learner 's direct exposure to real-life stimulation and the common learning experiences of teacher and student( Antler, 112-13). Later in her career, Mitchell successfully adapted her theories to the elementary social studies themes of geography and history. <p> Current advocates of curriculum emphasizing local and personal understandings include Gail Hickey, James Percoco, and advocates of constructivism. Hickey( 2000) found that elementary teachers who use family and local history projects enhance the development of classroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have students explore the world around them. Constructivists like Novack and Gowan( 1984) and Brooks and Brooks( 1989) noted that active learning involves feelings and actions that are accomplished by making sense of one 's personal environment. They believed that children construct knowledge by connecting new information to existing understandings. <p> America 's first educators also reinforced personal and local understandings by introducing a curriculum of practical knowledge, reinforcing the behaviors and skills for dealing with one 's immediate surroundings. That curriculum was their key to citizenship development for a new democratic nation. To illustrate this point, I have analyzed a variety of New England textbooks that were published in the first few decades of the nineteenth century and have found that an emphasis on personal and local understanding fostered democratic citizenship development. America 's First Expanding Environment Curriculum <p> To create the first generation of democratic citizens in nineteenth-century America, such local New England educators as Jedediah Morse, Noah Webster, Hannah Adams, Caleb Bingham, and others wrote textbooks that were specifically designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted new Americans to understand their place in America 's past and present and to become active members of their community. Instead of beginning in the remote past or a faraway place, students immersed themselves in their own surroundings. In an effort to introduce educational material that was considered more relevant, useful, and practical for an American audience, those educators introduced content other than traditional Biblical and classical material. <p> Arguing that a local understanding was far more necessary for the development of democratic citizenship than a knowledge of Europe, educators wrote textbooks that emphasized the development of self, community, and country. Those textbooks established the scope and sequence of America 's first citizenship education curriculum( Schwartz 2001). To become active and productive citizens, educators believed, young Americans first had to understand themselves and their personal environment. Only then would students be able to relate the past to the present in a meaningful way. Themes of Early Citizenship Development <p> To accomplish the goal of creating contributing citizens, many early nineteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasized three important themes that were believed necessary to mold an activist American identity. The themes all stemmed from the personal and local aspects of life and included the development of common language and communication skills, the development of individual self-governance in the form of personal control and behavior, and an understanding of history as it connects to local and current issues and ideas. Such themes of citizenship appeared in the local reading, history, and geography textbooks of New England schools in the first few decades of the nineteenth century. <p> The distinction between various subjects was not as clear then as it is today. Readers, such as Webster 's( 1814) Elements of Useful Knowledge, Piedmont 's( 1824) The National Reader, and Bentley 's( 1825) The American Instructor, all incorporated local history, politics, documents, and speeches as important reading material. Geography texts like Morse 's( 1804) Geography Made Easy and his( 1816) Universal Geography included historical and geographical material. Morse also instructed teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geography. <p> The first major theme throughout the textbooks was an emphasis on communication skills and a common language. Noah Webster was one of the first to believe that Americans should speak their own language( Unger 1998 ; Nietz 1961). Shortly after the American Revolution, Webster created a series of popular spellers, grammars, and readers. In the preface to his fourteenth edition of An American Selection, Webster( 1814) describes the importance of " transfusing " famous American speeches " into the breast of the rising generation. " Fearing those speeches might become " neglected or forgotten, " Webster wanted new Americans to read, hear, and understand what noble rebelling colonists had felt during the recent revolution. He believed that those speeches were " not inferior to the orations of Cicero and Demosthenes " and would " impress interesting truths upon young minds "( preface). <p> But Webster wanted his students to learn much more than words from the written speeches. He wanted the new U.S. citizens to develop such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Webster and the other early educators believed that the development of an American language was an important component of citizenship development. To understand each other, people had to communicate properly and clearly. According to Webster( 1815, 5), one important rule of speech was to " let the sentiments you express be accompanied with proper tones, looks, and gestures.... A speaker should endeavor to feel what he speaks. " Webster even gave specific directions for expressing certain " passions " or " sentiments, " like " mirth, pity, grief, and fear. " He described courage as " steady and cool passion that opens the countenance and gives the whole form an erect and graceful air. The voice is firm and the accents strong and articulate "( 6). He wrote, however, that boasting " is loud and blustering,... eyes flare,... the face is red and bloated "( 7). <p> Other contemporary reading textbooks echoed Webster 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the importance of language for citizenship. Rensselaer Bentley 's( 1825) The American Instructor " initiates children into the first principles of our language " by instructing them in the " meaning of words " and " a sense of the writer "( preface). After including the Declaration of Independence as a reading selection, Bentley declared, " This is the language of America, of Reason, and of Truth "( 197). Like Webster, Bentley wanted all American citizens to go beyond the mere knowledge of words ; he wanted new citizens to possess America 's language. " In every Town, County and State in America, " he noted, " are offices of honour and profit which some of you... will be called upon to fill.... To hold office U.S. citizens have to read well, write a fair hand, and understand the use of figures "( 43). Bentley even explained how two citizens should carry on a conversation : " Look him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer respectfully ;... let modesty and decency govern your words and deportment ;... do n't over speak ;... know when to be silent "( 180-82). <p> In a similar manner, Caleb Bingham( 1815) wrote about the " Importance of Studying the English Language Grammatically " in his reader, American Preceptor. Just as the Romans and Greeks studied their own language, Bingham urged young Americans to study English because the " freedom, liberty, and the life of our country depend upon it "( 156-59). <p> Like the reading texts, the geography books emphasized local language and communication by introducing a vocabulary of place. Jedediah Morse( 1804) noted in the preface of his book Geography Made Easy, " To discharge the duties of public office with honor and applause, the history, commerce, productions, peculiar advantages and interests of the several states ought to be thoroughly understood. " Morse lamented that until in the early 1800s, American students " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Asia, than that of their own state and country.... We have seldom pretended to write, and hardly to think for ourselves. " Morse and such other geography writers as Dwight( 1795), Olney( 1828), Willett( 1814,1822), and Goldsmith( 1811) provided a common vocabulary of local geographical terms, places, maps, and features. Goldsmith even titled his book A Grammar of Geography, and Willett( 1814) named his book An Easy Grammar of Geography. Obviously, geographic vocabulary terms were important. <p> An 1814 edition of Morse 's Geography Made Easy -- the eighteenth edition -- included an expanded vocabulary section that had grown from thirty pages and twelve definitions in the 1804 edition to fifty-two pages and thirty-four definitions. Some additions included such terms as political divisions of the Earth, inhabitants, forms of government, and religions. In both the definitions and descriptions of the Earth, the emphasis was on the local. For instance, in describing political divisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. the most improved... Africa the most barbarous... Asia the wealthiest... and America the largest, the grandest, as to its mountains and rivers, the least populous and wealthy "( 43). In his 1804 edition, Morse defined America 's waterways, as the world 's greatest : " no part of the world is so well watered with springs, rivulets, rivers and lakes "( 67). Although all the geography textbooks I reviewed noted many geographical areas of the world, each began with and emphasized the New England states. Morse( 1804,96) noted that New Englanders speak English " with great purity, " whereas in the middle and southern states, the language " is corrupted " because of " the great influx of foreigners. " <p> A second theme dealing with self and citizenship was the matter of personal control or duty, which was often termed self-government. Many educators believed that for such a large republic to survive every U.S. citizen had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was often repeated in early textbooks and speeches concerning education. To achieve communal harmony, discord in the form of personal extremes or excess could not be tolerated. Bingham( 1815), in American Preceptor, for instance, compares American society to a heap of glowing embers, " when placed asunder, can retain neither their light or heat... but when brought together... give heat and light to each other "( 172). Readings in The American Preceptor urge moderation and personal obligation : Sensual excesses... debase, corrupt and brutalize... moderation is essential to true pleasure( 20). Blessed is that nation whose sons and daughters are trained to virtue, honor and usefulness "( 49). " The way to wealth... depends chiefly on two words, industry and frugality ; that is waste neither time nor money, but make the best use of both "( 73). In a discussion of female education, Bingham noted, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the world conspiring can not make a woman happy who does not govern her passion "( 91-92). In a piece called " A Short System of Virtue and Happiness, " Bingham showed how individual governance was connected to the governance of society : <p> My duty to myself is, indeed, intimately, connected with my duty to others. By preserving the faculties of my mind and my body, and by improving them to the utmost, I am enabled to exert them with effect to the service of society. I am connected with others by the ties of consanguinity and friendship, and by the common bond of partaking in the same humanity.( 21) <p> Historian Hannah Adams( 1805, 16) noted in her History of New England that " education and early habits form the great outline of human character.... It is the command of heaven, that we use every exertion to improve the talents which our great Creator has afforded us. " She believed that America 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could model their own behavior : <p> Let us of the present age be instructed by our ancestors ' example, to guard against the prejudices of ignorance, and under their wise institutions, improved as they have been by succeeding generations, let us be careful to acquire a competent fund of information for the correct discharge of the duties of our respective situations in society.( 58) <p> Bentley( 1825) also emphasized similar themes of self-government : " It is of utmost importance that we rule our own tongues "( 102). " Happy is that man... who is master of himself, his time and his fortune "( 137). " Have arms for your defense, but have none for offence "( 199). Webster( 1814,63), quoting Dr. Belnap 's address concerning self-government in education, noted that good instructors " must teach by their example as well as their precepts ; that they must govern themselves, and teach their students the art of self-government. " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in early U.S. textbooks was the inclusion of local and recent history. The topics dominate early nineteenth century geography, reading, and history books. Educators connected the past to the present in a variety of clever and interesting ways. The revolution was only several generations old, but many of America 's school-aged citizens had not been actively involved. Educators wanted young people to understand the sacrifices and courage of their fathers and grandfathers. " Honorable age is not that which standeth in length of time, nor which is measured by numbers of years, " said Webster( 1814,106). Adams( 1805) noted, " Americans have raised their character to a level with that of the bravest people recorded in history "( 99). " Their judgment in forming their policy... was consistent with the best, greatest, and wisest legislators of antiquity "( 27). <p> Histories, geography texts, and readers often blurred time periods by connecting past events to present-day occasions. Authors sometimes included a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short past. Sometimes they would juxtapose a great speech from antiquity as part of both events. At other times an author would stay with one theme by using a variety of literary material from several time periods. <p> In his 1814 textbook, Webster included a " current " speech of elderly Boston Congressman Ames advocating the passage of a treaty between America and Great Britain( 153-61). Just before that selection, the author included the " Declaration by the representatives of the United Colonies of North America setting forth the causes and necessity of their taking up Arms against Great Britain, July 6th, 1775 "( 146-53). Right after the Ames speech, Webster inserted a speech by Cicero in which he castigated Verres for pleading immunity from Roman punishment merely because he was a wealthy citizen of the state( 161-64). <p> Pierpont( 1829) also blurred time periods. For example, he included an account of the landing at Plymouth in 1620 by Robertson and Neal( 196), which is followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that this grand industry was accomplished on the spot where we dwell "( 200). Next Pierpont included a variety of commemorative poems about the Pilgrims and ended the segment with a narrative, the " Character of the Puritan "( 213). Later, Pierpont used the theme of the beginning of the Revolution to gather Patrick Henry 's speech( 221), William Pitt 's speech to the British Parliament( 219), an account of the attack on Lexington and Concord by Botta( 223), and an early nineteenth century oration delivered at Concord, in which the speaker states : " This is a proud anniversary for our neighborhood "( 229). Pierpont ended that segment with several poems commemorating Concord and Bunker Hill. For the final selection of his reader, Pierpont connected the past to the present by including a speech by Daniel Webster delivered on August 2, 1826, at Boston 's Faneuil Hall( 260-61). The speech describes the common lives of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on July 4, 1826. <p> The authors of all the textbooks I examined emphasized the contemporary celebration of the Fourth of July along with the original eighteenth century event. Bentley( 1825), for instance, took a backward look : <p> Still do their sons retrace with proud delight the record of their fathers ' noble deeds.... Although most of the sages and heroes of the Revolution have yielded to the law of nature,... yet their mantle still rests on their sons.... The enthusiasm with which the return of this day is hailed, is a pledge to the spirit of seventy-six.... Let the youth grow up amidst annual festivals, commemorative of the events of war ;... let his first study be of your declaration of independence and the code of the constitution.( 198-99) <p> Bingham( 1815) uses a Fourth of July oration that John Quincy Adams delivered in 1793, when he noted that " millions of hearts which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been translated to brighter worlds. " Adams directed his words to those who were too young " to partake of the divine enthusiasm which inspired the American bosom " and hoped that if a time for fighting should again arise, the new generation would live up to those of the past and be " faithful disciples "( 142-45). <p> In nineteenth century geography books, July 4, 1776, was a date that marked a changed geographical description of the United States. In Universal Geography, Morse( 1804,97) described what is now the eastern seaboard of the United States as a possession of Great Britain until July 4, 1776, and Goldsmith( 1811, 11) explained that before the Fourth of July, the area was " denominated the American Colonies " <p> Another method of using local history and connecting the then and now was to talk at length about America 's " natural curiosities. " Pierpont( 1829) noted in his reader how the British <p> sneer at our country because it has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @.. nothing to connect the imagination... with the past ; no recollections of former ages, to associate the past with the future.... I can not judge of the recollections excited by castles and towers that I have not seen. But I have seen... those lonely tombs of the desert -- seen them rise from their boundless and unpeopled plains. My imagination and my heart have been full of the past.( 44-45) <p> Early history, geography, and reading books discussed America 's natural wonders as a means of connecting the past to the present. All textbooks describe Niagara Falls from a variety of time perspectives. Bingham( 1815) discussed how time and " the great quantity of water " had worn away the stone " for about seven miles up towards Lake Erie, and a chasm is formed which no person can approach without horror "( 170). Pierpont( 1829) noted, " When the admirer of nature 's wonders visits Niagara, he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these woods during many centuries, as the foam of the cataract has risen daily, to fall again, and to be swept away "( 99). Morse( 1816) wrote that the Indians never pass the falls " without offering a sacrifice of tobacco to the spirit of the water "( 64). Conclusions and Areas for Further Study <p> Educators recognize the importance of individual empowerment as a condition of democratic life. That empowerment must begin early in a child 's education. Young citizens become empowered by discovering relationships between their own personal environment and the past, present, and future environments of the external world. Regardless of time and place, uncovering one 's personal and local identity connects a student to his or her past as well as present. Such connections not only make history more relevant and meaningful but also allow students to understand their particular place in society. <p> This research shows the insight of our nation 's first generation of educators, who understood the importance of studying the familiar through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important part of America 's citizenship curriculum throughout its educational history. Many early educators rejected traditional content to connect the here and now to the development of democratic citizens. They accomplished that task through the creation of original textbooks in the areas of reading, history, and geography. Very little is known about the motives, strategies, and background of those authors, but we do know that instead of emphasizing unrelated facts and ideas, they carefully identified and implemented three important citizenship themes : communication skills, self-government, and local history. All wrote popular textbooks that were used in hundreds of New England schools and elsewhere to educate the world 's first generation of a modern democracy. Researchers today need to understand the motives and assumptions of the first U.S. educators. That information might help the emerging educational systems of newly created democratic nations to create their own personal and local social studies curriculum. <p> Studying early American educators may also help current and future U.S. students to understand their roles and responsibilities in today 's increasingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ethnocentric tradition in the teaching of American social studies, it does foster interest and citizenship understanding for a variety of age groups. Perhaps elements of the Expanding Environments curriculum should be as common in middle and secondary social studies curriculums as it is in the curriculum of elementary school. <p> Key words : citizenship education, early American education, nineteenth century education, studying local history and geography <p>
