4020041 SAFETY IN HEALTH CARE <p> Health care facilities can be hazardous to your health! The safety of hospital patients( or rather the lack thereof) has been well studied. In 2000 The Institute of Medicine report, " To Err is Human, " stated that the annual number of patient deaths due to medical errors could be as high as 98,000, most of which could have been prevented( Kohn et al). <p> Patients are not the only ones subject to health and safety risks. Health care providers have four times the risk of incurring musculoskeletal injuries( MSIs) compared to workers in other industries( Charney and Hudson, 2004). Injury rates to nurses and other caregivers run as high as 83 injuries per 200,000 work hours( Garg and Owen, 1992). Injured nurses suffer emotionally, socially and financially( Charney and Hudson, 2004). The costs resulting from MSIs in the Unites States are estimated at $13.2 billion( Liberty Mutual, 2004). WHAT IS A SAFE ENVIRONMENT? <p> Safety has become a buzz word in health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles discussing this topic in one way or another. It is hard to find a hospital, long-term care facility, or clinic without multiple safety initiatives. Safety projects with creative names such as " Safest in America, " " Pause for the Cause, " and " 100,000 Lives " are just the tip of the iceberg. Safety has also become a key criterion for accrediting bodies such as the Joint Commission for the Accreditation of Health Care Organizations( JCAHO), regulating bodies such as health departments, and third party payers such as insurance companies and Medicare. <p> Unions representing nurses have taken a strong stand in support of initiatives to decrease injuries, particularly back injuries, by incorporating safety measures into their contracts. Contract language can include initiatives such as requiring hospitals to install lifting equipment or implementing educational programs for staff safety. <p> Historically, an unsafe environment was seen as caused primarily by human error. In this view, errors were explained as failures in the actions performed by caregivers( Dekker, 2002 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caregiver whose performance violated a certain guideline, policy, or standard. For instance, medication errors were considered the result of a nurse not following the " 5 Rights. " The belief was that these errors could be controlled or eliminated by blaming the caregiver for not following the guidelines, policies or standards. Punitive action was frequently a logical result( Marx, 2001). This approach has been shown to be ineffective because it leads to underreporting and hiding of errors for fear of retaliation( Dekker, 2002 ; Krause, 2006). <p> Sidney Dekker( 2002) presents a more contemporary view of what factors create a safe environment. Key components include the principle that error is a symptom of deeper system problems, not necessarily the result of an individual 's erroneous actions. Safe care can only be delivered in an environment in which safety is the goal of all, and errors and injuries can be discussed without fear of negative consequences. This environment is a climate free of blame in which all people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety -- in which the focus is on creating safety. It is also an environment in which patients, caregivers and administrators function with a common understanding of what safety is, and lessons learned from near misses, good catches, errors and injuries are hardwired into the system( Dekker, 2002 ; Krause, 2006 ; Marx, 2001 ; Reason, 2000 ; Reason, 1990). <p> With all the work being done in the areas of patient safety and caregiver safety, we might assume that these two sets of initiatives are closely intertwined. Unfortunately, this is frequently not the case. Caregiver and patient safety initiatives use different paradigms and are based on different assumptions. PATIENT SAFETY <p> In most health safety initiatives, the patient is the main focus. Objectives include decreasing patient falls, bedsores, medication errors and other negative outcomes. Approaches to addressing these types of problems are based on an environment which is free of blame and in which reporting of errors is transparent. Most health care institutions have abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in-depth analysis follows incidents of error or patient injury. No stone is left unturned as all factors that contributed to the error are analyzed by a multidisciplinary team including caregivers, managers, administrators, and other key players. <p> Once the analysis is complete, a plan to prevent similar injuries/errors is created and implemented. Information that can lead to injury prevention is shared with other areas and, in some cases, other institutions in an effort to prevent similar injuries in the future. To promote this process, health care institutions are protected by peer review guidelines, meaning that information discovered during the analysis of errors can not be subpoenaed or used against the organization in a court of law( Marchev, 2003). CAREGIVER SAFETY <p> Nurses and other caregivers are vulnerable to injuries at work. MSIs have historically been considered a risk inherent in nursing work, caused by poor body mechanics( 0wen, 2000a, 2000b). <p> The typical approach to addressing staff injuries is markedly different than for patients injured through errors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager and their employer 's occupational health department. The injured nurse is treated for the injury and, if possible, returns to Work after having recovered. An in-depth analysis such as occurs when a patient has been injured is uncommon or nonexistent when the injured person is a caregiver. <p> Addressing injuries in caregivers commonly uses traditional occupational health models based on the premise that employee injuries occur because of exposure to risk factors. According to this premise, nurses can avoid injury by not exposing themselves to those risk factors ; thus, when nurses stop performing certain high-risk tasks, injuries will stop occurring( DiBenedetto, 1995). This model has been very effective in decreasing injuries in industrial settings. In the early 1900s, Alice Hamilton documented the strong correlation between the presence of lead in the workplace and occupational illness and even death. The elimination of lead was a dramatic improvement for workers( Hamilton, 1911). Unfortunately, many employers were reluctant to make changes until legislation and enforcement were introduced( MacLaury, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so successful, this occupational health model continues to be used today. <p> When attempting to solve the problem of MSIs in nursing, the occupational health model is the primary model implemented. Based on the assumption that eliminating risks will decrease injuries, a seven-point strategy can be identified in the literature : <p> -- Manual handling of patients should be avoided except for life-threatening situations( State of Texas, 2005). <p> -- Proper lifting equipment should be available and used when patients are handled( Nelson, 2006). <p> -- Nurses should be educated on the use of lifting equipment( Nelson, 2006). <p> -- Transfer techniques should be standardized and focused on the elimination of manual handling( Patient Safety Center of Inquiry( Tampa, FL), Veterans Health Administration and Department of Defense, 2001). <p> -- Punitive policies should be implemented that hold nurses/caregivers accountable for using equipment( Charney and Hudson, 2004 ; Garg, 2006). <p> -- Legislation requiring the implementation of safe patient handing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hudson, 2004). <p> -- Incentive programs should be implemented for leadership that demonstrates a decrease in the number of injuries( Wu, 2006). <p> The financial benefits of decreasing the number of reported injuries have been shown to outweigh the cost of training and equipment( Charney and Hudson, 2004 ; Chhokar et al., 2005 ; Nelson, 2006). Currently, the actual number of injuries can be measured only by tracking the number of reported injuries. THE PARADOX <p> Even though safety in health care institutions is being addressed, patient and staff safety are addressed using different paradigms. Errors and injuries including patients are being used as learning opportunities and as a means to understanding factors that can improve safety. Patient safety officials focus on the individual case while establishing procedures and guidelines that might benefit other patients. When a similar patient error/injury recurs, the health care team goes back to the drawing board to adjust the system. <p> The approach for care provider injuries, in contrast, is very different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are known -- namely, an individual nurse not acting correctly. Thus, individual analysis is unnecessary ; implementation of policies and corrective actions are the logical next step. Yet blame and punishment have been shown to decrease or even totally stop reporting. Offering managers financial incentives to decrease the number of injury reports promotes underreporting. Reporting an injury to one 's superior who is financially affected by that report could easily become an unpleasant experience. Research on decreasing MSIs has shown that the largest decreases in injury reporting occurred when the use of equipment was legally mandated. <p> The current rule-based approach to workplace safety for nurses can lead to several problems : INTENT VERSUS RESULT <p> The intent of the implemented safety measures is undoubtedly to decrease staff injuries, which would benefit both the institution and individual nurses. But the results of those measures should be monitored closely. The following areas are especially prone to unintended and/or undesirable results : <p> -- Implementing punitive policies with the intent to encourage nurses to protect their own safety could result in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be injured, but also would lose compensation for their injuries. <p> -- The intent of giving managers financial incentives to decrease reported injuries is to foster highly involved leadership, but the effect could be an environment in which reporting injuries becomes difficult. <p> -- Creating policies on lifting with the intent to create a safe environment could promote the message that nurses do not or should not have the ability to make choices that are best for themselves. <p> -- Providing lifting equipment has the intent of creating a safer environment, but numerous patients are injured or killed every year in mishaps related to the use of lifting equipment. <p> The relationship between patients and nurses is very complex, involving individual needs, communication, power dynamics, expectations, and other factors. Algorithms and standards can be helpful in determining the best care, but these must not eliminate the nurse 's ability to make knowledge-based decisions. The implementation of algorithms and policies from which nurses are not allowed to deviate except in life-threatening situations leads to nurses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations and personalities are not taken into consideration. Enforcing algorithms makes nurses ' work " invisible " by neglecting the value of nurses ' knowledge of the patient and his or her care. The patient is made " invisible " by ignoring specific problems such as pain, anxiety, and previous experiences. ETHICAL/MORAL ISSUES <p> The current approach to preventing injuries to nurses also raises ethical issues, including : <p> -- Is it acceptable for patients to be exposed to increased pain, discomfort, and/or risk injury in order to protect nurses? <p> -- Should nurses have to expose themselves to the risk of injury as part of delivering patient care? <p> -- If a policy is in conflict with a nurse 's professional judgment what should the nurse do? <p> The dilemmas described above can lead to a " grey zone " in which whatever action the nurse chooses could have negative moral consequences. For instance, deciding not to use lifting equipment when transferring a highly anxious patient in order to minimize the negative impact on that patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could lead to termination. On the other hand, if the nurse does use lifting equipment but perceives that he or she is inflicting avoidable discomfort or even terror on a patient, this action could lead to moral distress. Knowingly placing people in the " grey zone " is wrong - It strips people of their personal integrity( Card, 2002). SOLVING THE PARADOX <p> One solution to the paradoxical approaches to safety would be to adopt the same models for staff safety and patient safety. Nursing safety initiatives appear to focus on trying to create order out of chaos - that is, trying to gain control of a complex, multi-faceted situation. However, thinking that we can gain control over nursing staff injuries may be oversimplifying the complexity of what it means to offer care. A more fruitful approach is recognizing all the factors involved in transferring patients. This would be a model in which each injury is analyzed in a non-punitive manner, and events are used as lessons learned. Nurses ' and patients ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outweigh the other. Frameworks such as Margaret Urban Walker 's expressive-collaborative model of creating moral understanding in interpersonal dynamics and power structures can help nurses understand their own safety needs as well as those of their patients. Each person 's integrity would be taken into consideration and respected. Interventions would take interpersonal relationships, power dynamics, and contextual factors into account. <p> Whatever safety model is adopted should focus on helping nurses understand how to judge unsafe situations in real time, maintaining the emotional, social, and physical integrity of both patient and nurse and simultaneously allowing nurses to maintain their professional autonomy. SUMMARY <p> Creating an environment that is truly safe for both nurses and patients requires the elimination of disparities in approaches to staff safety and patient safety. Patient safety approaches based on transparency and blamelessness are effective tools in developing an environment that is constantly improving itself. <p> In addition to creating a safe and blame-free environment, creating a new model that nurses can use in real time would allow for rapid decision-making that maintains the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
