4166541 # A girl plunged into the gap between the train and the platform, and Leo 's forklift arms caught her before her chin slammed, possibly, impossibly, onto concrete, before she vanished toward the bed of the tracks, where only extreme measures would reach her. Shrieks. This had never happened, not even close. A miracle that people stopped jockeying to storm First Class and claim the single seats. She might be five years old. His red cap slipped off. The mother had shot ahead on her cell phone and now raced back to kneel beside Leo and her child 's head. His affliction of temporary muteness was upon him, but a man stepped forward to reinforce Leo 's grip and shouted for someone to inform the conductor. The girl dropped into an intensity of silence, her temple against his ; a single, light hair of hers probed his eye. The mother sobbed out, " Oh, Rose, " and he and the man hauled her up, and he still failed to find his voice but within seconds Rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. She showed no ill effects from all that lunchtime cabernet washing down the seafood paella and trifle. These delicate women often drank like lords on the Acela, gliding in a safe passage where rules were suspended. In his decades working on trains, it was a code Leo understood. # " You gave us quite a scare, " he said-or were the words only in his head? -but the slip of a child had already vanished with her mother while the passengers heading from Penn toward Boston clamored in with the ghoulish giddiness of sharing how it felt that a girl had almost died, just like that, and out flowed the afternoon wine. # From his theater training, Leo was versed in how fright swept in after-sometimes long after-a performance, and he waited for the delayed tremor. Agnes once told him how locusts over the prairie could swarm for a vertical and horizontal mile, so thick that they got swept along without contributing wing beats, drilling into everything in their path, leaf, bark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his mild business but collapse into madness years afterward. Ama pearl divers, who held their breaths for inhuman spans, could be retired and suddenly their eyeballs burst into flaming red. What undid him, though, was a well-behaved boy with his mother in a Viewliner Roomette on the Lake Shore Limited rumbling toward Chicago 's Union Station, holding his stuffed toy seal to the window and saying happily, when Leo arrived for their dining-car reservations, " Look, the world is going by! " and the mother smiled, her eyelids dropping in the dreamy lulling caused by the wheels, and Leo said he hoped the seal was enjoying the journey, and the boy said, " Oh, we all love it, sir! " and Leo remained composed until they disembarked and he treated himself to a room at the Palmer, where he buried his face in his hands to muffle his sobs. He was remembering his long-deceased son, of course-Tobias like a soft-boiled egg remaining whole only to age seven-but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeming just beyond reach. # On the Southwest Chief leg, slicing like a bar sinister from Chicago to Los Angeles, he almost got caught stealing. The doors on the bedrooms and roomettes were lockable only from the inside, and it was easy as apple pie to slip in and palm a small thing that would scarcely be missed. He was supposed to be in the rooms, turning down the shelf-like beds, tidying up, checking for enough blankets, enough towels near the toilet compartments that could be sealed up and used as a shower. At first, he 'd taken only finders-keepers discards. A nickel on a floor, a Cubs decal with backing still intact. A nameless luggage tag shaped as a whale, paperclips, soap in the form of a daisy. He progressed to more Lost-and-Found-worthy paraphernalia : a Blackhawks T-shirt, a tie clip of the Roman Coliseum. Pocket mirrors. Mystery novels that looked steeped in barrel water. Cadbury creme eggs, souvenir magnets, saucers, ceramic dishes, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never took booze, too easy to notice missing. # Lately, though, he 'd developed an itch for bigger items, which he 'd avoided so far, unless he counted that stolen hour on the California Zephyr, ancient history, with a well-known television actress named Daphne Biers, his one and only betrayal of Agnes. But now he fought against taking iPads, cashmere pullovers, caramel-soft valises, fine shoes, alarm clocks, and once a silk scarf stamped with canaries despite Agnes 's wearing only solid colors according to some staunch personal code he 'd given up trying to decipher. # He stared at an open suitcase on a sofa waiting to be converted into a bed and reached under a custom-made button-down white shirt and pulled out a cobalt tie and stuffed it into his shirt pocket right as a tremendous thud slammed the train to a halt, throwing him against the miniature sink. The suitcase hit the floor, contents spilling. The train was n't moving. He knew when it was a death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these stops were " maintenance issues, " and that was n't untrue, though what needed maintaining was secrecy and calm while officials were summoned to scrape human flesh off the track and to assign the body parts a name. # Bill Wethers was in the narrow corridor, staring at Leo as he scooped the passenger 's belongings back into the suitcase. " Mancuso, " said Bill. " Hey. " # " Is it another one? " The tie bulged in his shirt pocket, and he felt Bill eyeing it. Blood pounded in his skull and his breath got as scant as in the days when stage fright ended his youthful semi-triumphs in the theater. # " Yup, trespasser, " said Bill. " What 's going on in here? " # " Guy left his suitcase open, and I 'm closing it. " His hands shook. " You sure it 's a trespasser? " He certainly could n't pull the tie out of his pocket and put it back into the suitcase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't Leo 's, though why was Leo going on his turningdown-the-bed rounds wearing his uniform tie but with a fancy blue one coiled like a plush snake on his chest? # Bill nodded. " We 'll need you. Got a minute? " # " Sure. " # Bill, built like a redwood and with a redwood 's capacity for issuing a cathedral-like silence in a Euclidean space around itself, was waiting. # " Let me finish up here and get my nerves in order. It 's hard to see what 's out there, Bill. Last one was n't more than a kid. " # Raised eyebrow, but Bill was on his way, and Leo heard his cheery, " Not to worry, folks. Not to worry. Just some maintenance, and then on we go, " before it faded. He stuffed the wretched tie into the suitcase and his shaking legs carried him to the team manager 's sleeper, where some of them were being assigned to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them, including Leo, were told to go out and check for any unlikely signs of life and wait for the pros. # The desert night, cool, ruffled his sleeves. Orange-pocked setting sun. The dead were called " trespassers, " and not " suicides " or " accidents, " because they were, with due deference to the technical truth, on company property when they lay down on the tracks and waited for annihilating pain and the oblivion that ceded to the protocols. Leo glanced over at Bill Wethers and Jack Jackson and Philly Jones forming a ring around what seemed like a yard bag of leaves assaulted by a storm. The ambulance approached, no sirens. Eyes half-shut, he walked over and stood with his colleagues as the EMT guys lifted onto a stretcher a young man who 'd been almost severed in half. Latino, maybe dark-Italian like Leo. His Garfield the Cat T-shirt was awash in red. Alley oop. Careful of the gusher. The poor bastard had been considerate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could be found. As the police interrogated Leo, his voice caught and worked to find itself, but he did n't know anything, none of them ever did, and the cops thanked everyone, no need to set up a crime scene, finito. # New Mexico, the return trip. A wolf skittered over red earth with a nap to it like a carpet 's. Past the Better Stay Inn near the Buzzards Nest Bar, Leo reacquired the sensation that made him adore trains- the country was unrolling itself in front of him, instead of him merely passing through-and decided to be grateful to the Trespasser for giving him an excuse to retire, one too many of them, he 'd say, especially on the heels of a sweet little child falling into that gap they kept droning a warning about. He 'd resign before he stole something too big to explain away. He owned a house, broken down though it was, in Brooklyn, bought when it was possible for a rails man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford such a wonder, thanks in part to selling his parents ' house, and Agnes and he could be frugal and get by for the twenty years, thirty if they were lucky, remaining to them on God 's spinning beach ball. # His farewell party was at Hobie " Bobcat " Carmichael 's flat in Greenpoint, Diet Cokes and a sheet cake from Food Emporium that Hobie 's wife, Glenda, had covered with " Best Wishes, Leo Mancusothe-MAN! " in quivery piping alongside a magazine cut-out of a train she 'd stuck, edges bleeding, directly onto the oleo-glossy frosting. Agnes did n't know his co-workers well and saw no point in missing her dancing class and sent regrets. Before Hobie-Bobcat relieved everyone of small talk by playing jazz piano, Leo was ribbed for being " a man of property, " and he endured an earnest toast about saving the girl who 'd fallen, followed by frivolity that she 'd likely slipped while Leo was eyeing someone " babelitious " -he flashed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to now he 'd thought he really had been heroic, when maybe his turning aside for a blink of an eye had allowed the near tragedy in the first place. He could n't recall ogling a woman. The truth was he 'd gone blank a split second. The moment was flat-out missing. # On one of the first evenings of his retirement, he came in from mucking out the rain gutters and discovered a note from Agnes that she was " throwing herself into dance, " meaning that she would not be home for dinner and he could help himself to the leftover monkfish. She was sixty-two, his age ; what did she mean? He unearthed the Pyrex dish from the refrigerator and frowned. The overboiled fish was white and turgid and edged in gray scum, like an old nurse 's old shoe. Agnes had thoughtfully provided some contorni on the table obscured with bills and other flotsam : baby carrots in their orange cellophane and Mallomars about to bid goodbye to their shelf life. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their cats, despite all of them having crossed over the rainbow bridge. His hand moved through empty air. He especially missed Maple, named not for her color-she 'd been black-and-white-but for her sweetness. # Cleaning up meant battling with the gigantic bamboo screen Agnes insisted upon using to conceal the garbage and recycling bins, and he hated how it reminded him of the screen set around the tub in the kitchen on bath night during his childhood in Bensonhurst. When not in use, the tub had had a plank over it to hold the tea supplies ; what Italian family drank tea instead of jolting dark coffee? Mother took her bath first, when the water was cleanest, and then Father splashed in it, presumably to interpose his spores between his wife 's and his sons ', with Leo and his brothers in the living room sharing a creepy feeling probably akin to that of siblings forced to take their turns with the same woman in a cathouse. # He let the balmy spring air cloak him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fandango Dance Studio on Atlantic Avenue, passing antique shops tucked near new wine bars and caf&eacute;s where the merry throngs thronged and resembled college football crowds that had declared they were more important than the game and were loudly rejoicing in its banishment. A swain in one of those defiantly undersized hats was texting and bumped into him and did n't apologize. Oh, what a crime. Oh, Lord, Leo was dissolving into one of those inner-trumpeting bores, loathe to let youth steal any hours. Come each nighttime, though, these golden children heaped branzino and three drinks onto credit cards because naturally their ships would come in, whereas no one in his old neighborhood had dined out, unless you counted the buffet at Bambino 's after Easter Mass, his craven uncles and brothers and the whole shooting match of cousins ready for a face plant in the all-you-can-stomach lasagna mantled with cheese suggesting the earth 's crust. Leo and Agnes, too, had foresworn restaurants and entertainment and fashionable clothing, which was why they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. # The dance studio smelled of gym socks but offered that marvelous squeak of soles on the honey-light polished floor that transported him to his happy life as a moderately skilled guard on the St. Aloysius junior varsity. The sight of his wife at the far end of the floor arrested him in the doorway. Agnes was still a gorgeous redhead, big as a showgirl, though not brassy. She was embroiled in a tango with a fellow in a skintight outfit, the whole cornball get-up, and the sides of their faces were glued together with the proper dose of don't-look-ateach-other sharpness, their arms thrust out full length, hands clutched. The music required an impassive bearing and so she wore it, but he recognized the smile a layer below it, because she was being allowed to be agile ; his darling was agile. His heart tried to slice its way out of his chest. Usually at night, the nights he 'd been home, she presented him with a face set in a grimace over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she suddenly appeared before him, the floor sailed over and the music dead in its tracks, Agnes pink-toned and exhaling hard, with the arm of Mr. Dancing with the Stars encircling her. He was shorter than towering Agnes, trim, black-mustachioed, damp hair the shade of melting crows, escaped from Leo 's own mirror two decades ago, and Leo twitched from the burden of not punching him. # " Yes? " said Agnes, as if this were where she lived and he 'd interrupted a party to hand her a Jesus brochure. Her face was glistening, round, unlined. # " I miss you, and I do n't understand why you 're here every night. For hours, " he said. He sounded parental, starched, rehearsed. Tremors signaled that incipient muteness might be difficult to keep at bay. # The protective hoofer turned to her-was he straight ; gay ; was it wrong to wonder? -and Agnes returned his look, and he said, " Aggie, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leo to a crisp turn and retreated elegantly toward the barre. # Aggie? Leo had never called her that. What was she, sunny land where they rotated crops? # " You need to be glad for me, " she said. " Is that too much to ask? " # " That depends. Agnes, come home. Let 's fix the house together. It needs attention. You 've been saying that for a long while. I agree. " # Before telling him that she had won a scholarship to a camp in Florida for tango dancers training to compete at national levels-that 's right, Leo-she enunciated in quavering fullness about how he 'd spent his life traveling and could not begrudge her a spring and summer away to pursue a dream of something that had started as a hobby but had flowered into a talent at this late stage, and instead of her age being a liability, everyone said it was the reason she brought depth to the moves, if he cared to notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm ; she let him rest his hand there. " Is Twinkle Toes also going? Is there a story here I should know about? " # " Leo, I ca n't believe you. " Her eyelids dazzled him with brilliant blue shadow. " Romulo and I are all about dance. I do n't know which team he bats for. I do n't even know how old he is. Maybe forty. What matters is we move in sync, and he thinks I am ageless, and so do the instructors who think I can go far. " Subterranean tears saturated her entire face. He did n't have a clue how to touch them away. # " What about your teaching job? " # Well, if he could quit his job, she was n't going to stay married to inflicting composition on community college kids, some of whom were the pasty variety probably spending their dark nights of the soul marinating in manifestos about guns. # It was scarcely a song 's length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her kissing him goodbye, Romulo double-parked on Underhill, engine idling as he leapt from the driver 's seat with what Leo felt to be an unnecessarily complex flourish, assisting Aggie before Leo could command his leaden feet to dash over and lift her gear into the trunk, and simple as that, she was gone, speeding down to the kingdom of oranges. # Very well! He would buttress and tidy the house ; imagine Agnes 's expression! There 'd be room-niches! -for National Tango Champi- on trophies, even if Romulo 's name were part of the engraving! Skype and phones would patch Agnes and Leo together, and spring was about to melt into summer, and her return would swiftly follow. # A bottle of zinfandel produced the inspiration that he would raise espaliers or some such in their backyard, stretching toward heaven as proof that he was using his time abundantly, shaking viewers with awe. And this creation would be made out of the bits and pieces he 'd stolen over many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crates of fabric and yarn and chipped glass and sparkling chains, and crockery he could smash into decorative pieces. Foil wrappers, wire, ribbons. His Italian forbearers had built cathedrals, knew brick and ironwork. A challenge! Agnes was telling him he should n't have come home to die. Bless her heart, leading him by example. # Two weeks of labor produced wire grids resembling an enormous cage of interconnecting angles, an airy maze waiting for its d&eacute;cor, with peaks rising in their midst as high as he could manage with his ladder. He reset the flagstones and replaced the broken ones, and he tore down the fence and set up more chicken wire held up by posts that he 'd interweave with whatever glittering objects made sense, a lattice of floating art that passersby could peek through to see the cage 's foundations growing into towers. He had a corner lot, one of the few in Prospect Park where the exposed parcel could be viewed from St. Marks Avenue. # One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when the bleeding was hard to staunch, he wrapped the wound in a paper towel and hurried to the CVS drugstore for bandages. Head down, he got in and got out. Large-box stores made him feel beamed into a spaceship where mouthless creatures with almond-shaped crevices instead of eyes were operating on him, so it was a shock when a young woman grabbed his arm in his fenceless yard and barked, " Hey! I was talking to you! " but not terribly surprising when she said he 'd stepped in front of her in the checkout line and she 'd trailed after him and wow, he was more or less her neighbor, a rude one. # " I 'm completely sorry, " he said. " I get oblivious in those places. Bright lights, I guess, too many choices. " He flashed a wan grin he hoped would send her on her way. # " That 's no excuse. " # He agreed it was not, and he apologized again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new code that it was acceptable to leave the house in tights visible from the waist down, which embarrassed him, a whole generation of women that had forgotten to wear pants. Her ripped, off-the-shoulder shirt with tank top beneath brought to mind a narrow escape from a mortal-combat ballet class. His palm dripped blood, and he fumbled for a Band-Aid in his CVS bag. She slapped it on him, as if she 'd stalked him homeward to convey how much his bleeding annoyed her. " Do you live here? I mean, is this whole house yours? " Sweet Jesus ; another white child angry at the rules of privilege shifting before she 'd fully collected. " What 's that weird thing you 're building? " She informed him that her name was Crystal Vanders, and she was suffocating in a spare room in her parents ' fancy, " chef's-kitchen bullshit duplex " down the street. # " I 'm Leo Mancuso, " he said, idiotically, but she 'd introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice to make your acquaintance, Miss Vanders. Now if you 'll excuse me. " He flashed on his ancient aunts being vocal about this lamb 's parents dooming her by giving her no saint to whom she could pray. # " But how can you afford a house? I mean, what the hell. " # " It 's all I have. I do n't drive. No fancy vacations. Et cetera. " He debated sprinting for his door. Where was Agnes, so they could share a laugh over this? " I suppose it 's a matter of saving everything up. Houses were cheaper when I was your age. There was that. And a person has to stay in one place. Equity. " # " My father runs a hedge fund, and he expects me to work for him. I need a job, but not that, he can kiss my ass. " # Leo was n't completely sure what a hedge fund was, though he 'd heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was disheveled, in her mid-twenties, with brunette hair chopped at odd angles. Her cat's-eye make-up was jarring on such a baby face, and she had a tattoo of a lily on her left outer arm. Funny they all had tattoos now, when getting them hurt like blazes. Maybe it was admirable, burning and etching yourself to make your bodily property unlike anyone else 's. He heard a voice he knew to be his, but it rose from a rooted spot beyond him. " You could help me build the towers. They need decorating. It 's too much for me alone. I 'll pay you. " # " You a perv? " # Was decency never to be presumed anymore ; was everyone suspect? The sky swam with melted blue. These young women perplexed him because they were beautiful in almost the same ways and there- fore failed to stir his blood, all of them with the same number of arm curls in every bicep, their veins dripping ten-dollar, high-sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crankiness. The voice from elsewhere ricocheted into his interior and bounced there, and the echo chamber pounded when he heard, " You are around the age of a grandchild I might have had, if my son, Tobias, had lived to produce offspring. There 's a huge gulf in my life, a lot missing. I would n't dream of- " But then it was upon him, the old block in the chest and throat, speechlessness, and Crystal said, " Whoa, mister, you OK? " and guided him around to his front stoop. She parked herself next to him and said, " How old was he? " # Leo held up one hand and the thumb and forefinger of the other hand. # " Seven? That truly bites. " # A nod. # " It 'll be like, I do n't know, decorating Christmas trees that are wire? The whack stuff you 're building. How much will you pay me an hour? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Band-Aid soaked through on one. # " Twenty? Deal. Dad 's a hedge-hog minus a clue about what I want. Not that I know myself. But just because I live at home, he thinks he owns me. " # Leo smiled, grateful that now when he heard about the movers and shakers who sucked the marrow out of the world 's bones and tossed them for others to bury, he 'd picture them as hedgehogs, and she said ten in the morning was as early as she could manage, and he nodded again. Youth was the era to squander nights flushing the soft tissues with memory-deleting fluids ; he remembered. # His voice returned for that night 's Skype session with Agnes, but he could n't fit a word in edgewise as she regaled him about a victory in a tango contest in Gainesville. A step closer to the state competition. She was as blurry as a reflection on a spoon. Romulo kept tilting into view in a manner Leo assumed was meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could tell her about his Towers-their Towers-and the neighborhood child he 'd hired to help turn them into-art, he supposed. # Agnes in perpetual motion, twirling ; he should hire a photographer to capture her lifted so as to appear levitating. Toby, so frail his eyelids were thin and blue-veined as a baby bird 's, once played an angel at a Christmas pageant ; he 'd begged them to allow it, and it was still a joy to take to the grave, his boy 's arms wide as he sailed up and swung around on the wires, flying, the audience gasping, applauding as Toby let out-stepping outside the script-a high-pitched shriek of sustained delight. # Agnes had once published fiction in magazines, and when she wondered what was missing, he urged her to stop imitating the stories about brittle people saying brittle things and write about their boy. He 'd found her sobbing at her desk, head pressed to a blank page, and the paper was soaked and smeared with lipstick and wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Artforum and said the title was " My Child Is Gone, " and they printed it and it gained a certain notoriety as a novel without words, and a miniscule Agnes Mancuso cult led to the teaching job, and that was the last story she produced. # They 'd each had dreams so far beyond their station that there was a tacit agreement they 'd neither deride each other nor exhort. # He gazed at the original, framed in their hallway, at its creases and stains, at the curious way tears do n't dry exactly like water. The purple red marbling a dagger down the center. It was a stunning abstraction. And then there was nothing to do but for him to go to sleep. # Crystal showed up as promised, punctual, in overalls, hair raked back with a thin band. He 'd set out his pirate 's treasure, the papers, trinkets, and stolen fragments, and she grinned and said, " Great. A hoarder. " # All at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child-like stranger at loose ends-that, at a loss, he dissolved into the deep inhaling he 'd learned in his other lifetime to battle stage fright, but Crystal either did n't notice or did n't have time for angst or chit-chat, because she dove in ; she went for the yarn first, weaving it in the wire grid guarding the yard 's boundaries that were like the spaces in a coloring book. People walking past or pushing strollers glanced in and went on. # Instead of tucking detritus at random into some gummy free-forall as he 'd planned, she created a clear wave pattern stretching along one wall. She fit the flat stolen things first into the outlines, and she struck buttons, earrings, and pointed things into that. She used the ladder to twist designs higher in the peaks rising like chimneys. Altogether everything looked like a seascape, and Leo was grateful that she worked without chatter-he had n't expected that-and with an authority that took him aback. She constructed platform-like shelves and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a birdcage at the bottom of the sea, Grandpa. May I call you that? I do n't mean it in a nasty way. My only grandfather agrees with my dad that I 'm a loser. " # He said she could call him that. He wrapped green ribbon around a crest. Everyone now had an ambition that would have mystified his father and uncles ; they 'd treated his own, his love of theater, as if he were setting out to insult them. When she asked if he were a widower, he said no. His wife was dancing in Florida. # " But when will Grandma come home? " Crystal was shaping birds, actual birds, nothing fancy, crows and gulls, among the wires using newsprint, foil, and cloth. # " She 's trying to win a prize, " he said. " After that, I do n't know. I love her very much. That 's about all I can say. " The taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her grandmother. At one point they could well run out of money. # For lunch he made panini, tomatoes and basil, pressed with a clothing iron, and Crystal sank into one of the director 's chairs he hauled from the shed. The sun turned a spotlight on the lily on her arm. She had the beginnings of a vertical crease on her forehead, too young for that, but there it was. " Was that yoga breathing you were doing earlier? " she asked. " For your panic attack. " # Aha ; it had n't gone undetected. He explained that an acting instructor had taught a class about handling the shock of being seen by slowing down and accepting that the terror was there. Fighting it was the mistake everyone made. # " You were an actor? Have I seen you in something? " # " God, no. All the breathing on earth was n't going to save me. I never got over whatever it was that paralyzed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " # " Too bad you were n't born in the silent era, " said Crystal. " You 'd be a star. " # " I doubt that. " But he was cheered, because he had n't thought of himself as being too young ; it was n't that he was old, after all. He was n't old enough. # She asked him to explain more about the breathing, because it would help her deal with her parents, who were on her case about doing more with her life. # " The idea is not to deny you 're afraid, " he said. He asked if she 'd like another panino, and she rhymed back with, " indeed no, " and while they laughed he was zapped with a vision of chasing an infant through sand, showing the child how to write names near the tideline in order to watch them gently get erased by sea. " They called it ' floating. ' You accept that you are consumed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good, sturdy American, you-I do n't know. Waft with it, through it, caring for it instead of getting rid of it. Only Americans think it 's wrong to have regrets. " Look at how those spaces he 'd wrought were filling in, better than he could have imagined or done, with waves and birds made out of the garbage he'd-what was the word? Collected. " I suspect your parents are only worried about you. " God, listen to him. # " Blah blah blah, gracias, Grandpa, " she said. " They 're moneygrubbing assholes, and my boyfriend, and I use the term loosely, trust me, is worse. " # He continued with more cringe-inducing blather about how her future loomed for the taking, and besides, young people these days were told they could be whatever they wanted. " Whereas when I told my parents I wanted to act, they said, ' Does n't one need a personality for that, Leo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # " All parents are jerks, get over it, " she said. " I do n't know how to earn my keep. I 'd be good at going to people 's houses and turning their garbage into art. I did n't know that until now, Grandpa. But I ca n't make a living at it. " # He said his livelihood had been working on trains. He 'd talked big, but he 'd ended up following in an uncle 's footsteps. She perhaps was n't listening. # " Did you ever do anything as an actor? " she asked. # " Some theater. And- " should he admit it? " I was in an episode of The Sopranos. " # Her inhalation was profound. " Grandpa! No shit! You were in the goddamned Sopranos? " She did that **25;920;TOOLONG thing he disliked, but he forgave it. # " It was the scene in Artie 's restaurant when Tony spots a young guy wearing a hat indoors, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows the rules- " " Pause for irony! " # " Exactly. He crosses the room, slowly, I think he buttons his jacket on the way, and he says to the kid, ' Take off your hat. ' Words to that effect. And the kid shrugs him off, but Tony 's a hulk and his crazy bright lamps are shining, and he does n't need to ask twice ; the kid slinks off his hat. We all wish we had that power. Preferably without having to be a homicidal psychopath. " This already vied for being the most sustained conversation he 'd had with a fellow human in he could n't say how long. # " So you were the young guy in the hat? Really?

Still very cool. He searched for advice to give a child who could find nothing and no one despite every advantage in a boundless existence, but she said, " Back to the task before us, slacker, " and left him to clean up the lunch. # In the rhythm of the days that followed, as the birdcages in the framed sea gained dimension-she knew where to attach foil to catch glints-they did not speak but occasionally shouted, apropos of nothing, " Take off your hat!

An animal groping in her compartment on the Zephyr, ruled more by a dread of being caught than lust. She tossed off a distressingly easy joke afterward about the earth moving during their clutching and stifled moans, and he wanted to say it was the train that had been moving, and they were only gliding over the earth. A predictably ordinary thrashing against growing older-what he would n't give to be that young again-and they left it as a one-night stand, but she got him into a cattle-call in New Jersey upon his return home. At the time he could n't detect that he wanted what she had, the roles, more than he desired her ; now it was easier to name her as a major star of minor things, and how baffling to have named that any kind of pinnacle. # He paid Crystal what he owed her for the day, and she pivoted to behold this useless, beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and it moved him how amazement possessed her, as if she had no idea how it had appeared. She 'd caked over a blemish on her chin with what Agnes called concealer, and it made him almost cry that Crystal might be self-conscious about an eruption of delayed growing up. # Agnes won the West Palm Beach tango competition and clarified that Romulo was not " interested " in her other than their shared focus on the state championships, coming up in two weeks. # " I 'll fly out to see you, Agnes. I 'd like that. Cheer from the stands. " # No, no, no distractions, please. She was nervous enough. Did n't he have his own distractions? Who was this raccoon-eyed little Miss, and why did Leo think Agnes would cherish e-photos of her alongside a bizarre jungle gym ruining the yard? # " She 's a child, Agnes, for crying out loud. I miss you, sweetheart. And we 're building a castle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the stealing. # " Or it 's a colossal monument to crap and you could throw it all out, Leo. " # They burst out laughing, because nearing forty years of marriage enabled people who loved one another to stop pretending that everything was grand, all stakes bent unto the end of the world. And then they had nothing more to say. # He envied the Midwestern childhood she detested, would have traded being bossed around by shelf-bosomed widows at the Zeppole booth for marveling within the vast reaches of the nation where the howling of coyotes carried full up against the door. Nebraska, cold and full of steaks, a place he thought of as snow and blood. Oh, Agnes. # The birds arrived, wings wide. Real ones. They sifted onto the ledges ; jays and cardinals and yellow, bitty songbirds he had n't known could survive in Brooklyn. They pecked at the yarn, stole it for nests. Flapping ends sent them flying. He had n't seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted. Crystal agreed it was unexpected, but that was a rule of art and therefore this was excellent. Birds in the nooks, squirrels furtive in the maze. Crowds gathering as the sculpture became kinetic. # The fun part was hammering ceramics into shards they glued here and there as jewels, the crowning touches. Take that! Smack of ham- mer. Take that ; take off your hat! People snapping photos and filming videos as birds rocked the towers, shedding d&eacute;cor. Crystal waving to onlookers, Leo comically bowing. # Time to say goodbye. # " One last thing, " Crystal said. She tucked away her final payment and shook his hand. " How did he die? May I ask, Grandpa? How did your little boy die? " # " He was born with a hole in his heart, and his cartilage never developed. A soft-shelled crab, he was. We were told at his birth he would n't last. Not that anyone does. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of us get beyond seven. One more thing I ca n't figure out. Why do words fail you so often? At first I thought it was because you lost him, I 'd get that, totally. But you had the problem before that. It could n't be just your parents not understanding you, because, like, join the club. " # She wore a Disney Frozen T-shirt and cargo pants, and a spray of turquoise was tucked like a plume in her uncombed hair. He had not asked about her dull, by-the-book parents and the worse boyfriend or all that much about her life ; he had no idea why everyone her age stayed children when he 'd been so eager, once upon a time, to jettison being dependent. A jay squawked ; was that the tie clip of the Roman Coliseum hitting a flagstone? He should retrieve it before a bird died swallowing it. Someone arriving at the perimeter shouted, " This is like crazy. What is it? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said. Summer, boughs bobbing down. # " Maybe you loved your boy so much the love flooded backward, to before you even knew you 'd know him, and it made everything beyond words, " she said, hardly above a whisper. " That seems amazing. I do n't know anyone who loves anything. " # He shut his eyes to stop seeing hers ; opened them ; lifted his head. People on the sidewalk stood two, three deep, craning for a glimpse of this insane aviary alive with living birds roosting among paper-andyarn ones. Snapping pictures. His tongue-tied affliction amounted to simple human failure ; he 'd never been destined for greatness. It was nothing so grand as she wanted it to be, but he was grateful she wished it so. # " That 's a lovely thing to bestow, my talented Crystal. I shall miss you, " and he kissed her forehead and she beamed. No point in offering ridiculous advice ; no need to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's biographies. The seascape bird chambers would n't keep, certainly not come winter. She was attractive, but he 'd felt nothing so long-he 'd edged farther, into some void where even feeling nothing was too much a feeling-that it was easy to stay cordoned off where he belonged. # When she asked what he planned next, he said he 'd go to the Botanical Gardens in the morning to see the Frida Kahlo exhibit. Dash his senses with bright colors. He 'd cross his fingers for his wife in her state championships in two days.( If only he had a fortuneteller 's gaze at what would unfold, he would never have dreamed of boarding the Metro North train going into that paradise of flowers in the Bronx.) " And you? " # " Put this job on my r&eacute;sum&eacute;, get told I 'm a fuck-up. This has been wild, Grandpa. Bye-bye, " she said, and turned and walked and did n't look back, but the next morning on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that spelled out TAKE OFF YOUR HAT!, and he did n't know if it was supposed to evoke a kindergartener 's work or the sad imposed therapy in an old folks ' home. He transported it into his house the way one carries an injured butterfly in joined open hands and set it on the table and watched a moment, as if expecting it to leave him on an upward draught. # Not that he coveted the tumult of Frida Kahlo 's marriage-nor did he envy the accident that left her in chronic pain-but he hungered after her hypnotic palette, and he wandered in the exhibit, past the cacti capped with pink buttercup-shaped blooms, absorbing the sunvibrant colors as they ignited brainstorms for turning his and Agnes 's house into a statement. Look at that shade of blue Kahlo had used to embolden the house 's face she turned toward the world-cobalt? Like ground-up lapis lazuli, precious stones out of a spice trade.... He stood three-people-deep to glimpse the paintings with the artist 's veins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the melting Vs of the birds Crystal had designed. A hummingbird dangling from a necklace of thorns. Some people took their allotted time and became world-famous artists and had raucous affairs and still made a house so particular and grand that a replication drew crowds. # Out in the Peggy Guggenheim Rose Garden, coral and white and lemon and violet and scarlet petals sifted, hybrids someone had dreamt up, giddily named. Peace and Marmalade and Prosperity. Mermaid! Magic Dragon! Living Easy! Parfait, Penelope, Prairie Princess. He phoned Agnes and got her voice mail. # " Darling, are you there? I 'm in the rose garden, Botanical Gardens. I know how it always makes you feel. Gardeners are deadheading the ones on the western wall. Sorry I missed your call last night, but I want to wish you luck again, with the big competition. I 'll fly out, last minute, you name it, angel. Good luck. " The sun poured its syrup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bride to walk upon. He could n't bear to ask when this would end. If she won the state contest, would there be nationals, internationals, and galactic matches? " People are admiring the towers I built. " He should say the " towers shaped because of Crystal 's ideas, " his raw goods but her lead, but it might sound wrong. He choked out please call, and I love you, before hanging up. # The gift shop offered a sweeping array of Frida merchandise ; what would she make of it all? Trays, oratorios, hats, oven mitts, books. Wallets, refrigerator magnets, stationery ; kaleidoscopic choice. He 'd pick out a frame better suited for Agnes 's Artforum story-withoutwords than the flimsy plastic one they 'd bought in a two-for-one sale. He selected one deep enough to be a little shrine, painted apricot with red roses entwined as trim, the apex forming a star. Frida in the well of the frame, removable. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stopped. Crystal Vanders was inspecting a tabletop of Frida kitchen linens, but his attempt to form the words, " Crystal? What are you doing here? Are you following me? " collided with more troubling questions, was she shadowing him, was she selecting his pathway because she was timid about finding her own, had he invited someone suspect into his home, his yard, was this trouble?, and his ability to speak deserted him. She had n't seen him yet. # A few strides behind her ; she still had n't noticed him. She glanced sideways, to the right, to the left. She scooped up a Frida Kahlo potholder and stuck it under her baggy shirt, tucking it into the waistband of stretchy black pants. He 'd seen them on women with rolled-up yoga mats carried on their backs like rubber kindling. He gasped as she grabbed a Frida tea towel and padded her other side with it. # One hand stretched toward her, the other tucked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the table. Words jostling for release met a flame of horror until, singed and ashy, they clogged his throat. An indifferent clerk was tending to a customer picking through ceramic plates. He was glued to the spot. Crystal lifted her head, saw him. She glanced to and fro before staring with a formless pleading, and she began a power-walk toward the exit. He dropped the frame ; the crash startled the clerk. The combustion inside him propelled the sole word left intact in him to the surface before he could stop it, because the word itself was, " Stop! " He 'd meant it only for her, but it came out loud. With his arm extended, pointing. # A rush of clerk, security guard, manager, police. Even when Leo tried to recall it later, it was a flurry of motion as relentless as an undertow sweeping her away. He found his full voice to tell the police officer, " I 'll pay for those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bald and stern, insisted that if they were nothing, they would not be actual things hidden on this young lady 's person. Leo got out his wallet ; the manager told him to put it away. Crystal 's face downcast, red, so quiet the quiet funneled into his ears. # He was n't told the station where she 'd be booked. But then again, what could he possibly say about any connection to her? He offered to pay on her behalf again ; they asked him to explain why he 'd keep them from nipping this behavior in the bud. He was doing her no favors. She shifted and folded her arms, and he wanted to tuck the hair behind her ears to stop it from hanging like a curtain. She 'd be charged with a misdemeanor, she 'd be looking at community service ; shop owners were tired of it all. # Would it have mattered, to have bailed her out, said he was sorry? # " I have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor in the gift shop, refusing to meet his gaze. " I do n't know him at all. " # Agnes and Romulo came up empty-handed in the Florida Tango State Finals. She phoned to say, " Leo, we almost won. We came so close, so close. " She was crying. He was barefoot in the kitchen with this electronic item smaller than a deck of cards stuck to his ear and had no comfort to provide as she said that she was going to stay on, work harder, train within an inch of her life, because they had a chance-everyone said so-of winning next time. When he suggested there were plenty of dance studios in New York, she explained with the exaggerated patience that 's the worst stripe of impatience that the coaches who believed in her, worshipped her, if he wanted to know, were here. # " I worship you, too. But I 'm not moving to Florida. " # The air went so dead the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you there, Agnes? " # " I 'm here, Leo. I 'm right here. Goodbye, my beloved, darling boy. " # The feature in The New York Times about " The Bird Towers of Brooklyn " led to YouTube postings, blog mentions, and a crowd that annoyed him immediately, intruders edging in, stealing souvenirs, leaving birdseed ; most often people only wanted a harmless recording of their presence, snapping photos with their phones. Once he dashed out like a madman, arms waving, because a boy was being allowed to throw rocks at the nest of the robin he felt called upon to protect. # He asked the Times to run a correction : They 'd omitted Crystal 's name in the original story, despite his giving her more than half the credit. They affixed a few lines on a bottom banner of a follow-up story about the crowds, buried on an inside page. # One night he awakened to such a commotion that he dressed hastily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find Crystal Vanders knocking the towers to pieces. The summer 's buzz of insects rose. " Crystal? " # Fists-one with a hammer-clutched as she shrieked, " Fuck you, Grandpa! How could you do that to me? " # He took a step closer. Squawking birds spiraled off. An iridescent stream followed suit. She shook a tower and it shed like a tree in winter. " I used to steal, " he said. " I 'd take things. On the trains. Nothing that could be called big. You 're the first person I 've told, so you tell me, because I have no idea. Why did I do that? " # Crystal pulled at some wires, tearing off an ocean wave as if yanking a sheet off a clothesline. He had another woman in tears. " How the fuck should I know? Go to a shrink and ask, you uptight old bat. Boo hoo, Bensonhurst, and now you 're rich because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't do the same. " # Rich? " Maybe I was hoping for the excitement of someone grabbing me and saying, ' Hold on right there. That 's mine. You have what belongs to me, ' " he said. He 'd never wondered before, not truly. Some thrill with getting away with a tiny crime, some issuing of a mysterious type of claim over what seemed so small to others. # She stopped and looked at him and used the back of her hand to wipe away tears. It would be wrong to go and hold her, to say, please, do n't cry. Do n't cry. # Quietly she said, " They stuck me with twenty hours cleaning up road trash and shit. It 's on my record now, though. " # " I 'm sorry. God, Crystal. I 'm so sorry. " # " You did n't even mention me in the newspapers. " # " I told the reporter about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you. They printed a correction. " # " Great. Thanks, Gramps. " But she was smiling, sniffling. # And the fireflies came, stirred by her knocking a tower. Throbbing dots, bodies lit, circling and darting, like miniature broken chandeliers over what had been the open-walled mansions of the birds that had left in a rush. A blue feather drifted. They were both, separately, encased in domes of wonder. He pointed at a figure of a child with an umbrella she 'd made out of tin( from a flat Christmas ornament shaped as a bell with a ribbon, from the Silver Meteor route), and said, " Take that. Do n't ruin it. Keep it. " # When she remained stock-still, he let the words whirling in his chest settle before he said, " Have at it. Knock it over. Do your worst, just do n't stay angry with me. " # Shuffling in his slippers, he moved the ladder to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robins. The lights shone ; it was empty. No eggs, no birds. Nothing to protect. She could proceed ; she knew where to find the wire-clippers and pliers. # " Take whatever you like, Crystal. Just forgive me. " A relief that the gawkers would quit coming by. He was desperate to be alone. He paused in the frame of his back door and said, " Find a studio, a perch if you have to, Crystal, and piece things together the way you want. You have the personality. Even if I do n't end up telling people I knew you when, at least I 'll know you 're being brave. " # He did n't wait for a reply, did n't take a last look ; enough already with goodbye and goodbye and goodbye. He found his earplugs so as not to hear everything coming down. # In the morning he feared going outside ; silence. Then whirr of the cappuccino machine, a gift from Agnes. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd go to see her, even if she decided to forbid it. Or maybe she would n't return. All he knew at this second was that she was not here, and her arrival was not imminent, and he was going to drink coffee. He sprinkled raw sugar crystals on the froth and admired how they spangled it. He said aloud-and burst out laughing- " Christ Almighty, Leo. You never heard of the Watts Towers? " So much for building some daring, original shrine! Someone had already done it, famously, better. Appropriating-that was the story of his life. The almost-almost of striving, the arc never quite cresting, or so it seemed. # What was that man 's name? Leo knew he was Italian, another talented odd-jobber. To postpone venturing outside, he searched Google : Sabato " Simon " Rodia. Watts Towers, National Treasure. Landmark of Historic Places. One tower thirty meters high. And Leo locked upon the Wiki reason Rodia quit-claimed the property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battling with the City of Los Angeles for permits and because he understood the possible consequences of his aging and being alone. " # Agnes was on YouTube, dancing, sharp, face unreadable, in another man 's arms. On the screen, she was the size of a dandelion puff. # Crystal had n't had the heart to pull everything down. She 'd taken a few things and started the rest toward wreckage. He set about finishing the task, gawkers notwithstanding, but he was too tired to haul the trash to wherever trash went when people decided their problems belonged to someone out of their line of sight. # When he sat up in bed that night in a cold sweat, he was still inside the fog of a nightmare that the mother of that girl who 'd dropped into the gap at Penn Station was screaming. Though shock had rendered her silent. She 'd been striding ahead on her cell, and suddenly she was required to be remorseful while Leo and another man extracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to swallow anyone, even such a slight little sweetheart. He listened ; the sounds in his yard were real. The screams surged into a monstrous groan. Something out of myth, gorgon, siren, mermaid bent on revenge, a dragon telling him to face the music, their music. # Cats! Cats must be mating in the debris of the Towers. That roaring awful racket, the caterwauling. It had to be one of the great mysteries as to why cats were always sullen but able to screech like that in the act of creating more of themselves. " Maple? " he shouted, still in bed, shaking off the last of sleep. Their cats were dead. Maple had had a fine sense of humor, leaping onto the curtains and swinging when Leo was present because Leo was royally entertained by it. He leapt up, flicked on the lights. # Cats swarmed around the junk piles, rolled in the yarn, rocked on each other like squirming bits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furry slinking, slithering. Perhaps drawn by the birds that had once been there. # At dawn, he began : He would re-set a wooden fence where it belonged. He would use the broken crockery-and get more, if he needed to, and proper tiles-to make a flat mosaic in the yard. Not visible to a casual bystander ; roped in, guarded. Yellow and red pieces to form birds on branches. Blue for waves, in honor of Crystal and their chaste, endearing version of an affair, not that she would know, not that anyone would. He 'd clear away the rest. Should there be visitors-should Agnes come home-he 'd show off his handiwork, born out of his own grandfather 's skill. In summer, the tiles would shine like gems. In winter, they would lie under snow that would crack the designs. One day he would be gone, the house sold. As the world grew, as children grew and needed space and their children needed space, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left, most likely cement would be poured over his mosaic. But for now he 'd treasure it as if he were no longer here but instead had been transported, carried wild awo dwell with all the joy he could summon among the Roman ruins of his ancestors.
