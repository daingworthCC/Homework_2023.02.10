1016441 The first i knew myself was in a white house on a hill. It looked out on a bright aqua sea and a smooth palm lined road below. Orchids bloomed and there were rare birds in the yard. One day I saw a man chopped to death outside the gate. The killers were uniformed. From every finger on their hands a knife blade bloomed. Silver bullets and shark 's teeth lined their throats. On their hips they wore diamond studded holsters for their guns. <p> " Who were they? " I asked my mother as the body bled to silence in the dirt. <p> " Shhh, " she whispered. " That 's History 's posse come back again. Oh what a crosses come down on me. Do n't ask me no more. Do, me baby keep quiet. Get inside and close the door. " <p> Some children were playing in the mud walking barefoot, eating guinep and singing " What canya do Punchinella little fella. What canya do Punchinella little gal. " <p> " Let me go and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said. <p> " Not today. History 's posse might be passing by. " <p> " Who is this History? " I asked. " I want to see his face. " <p> " Sshh! Child, nobody can look in History 's face. His people are everywhere like spies. He 's all around like the air " she whispered. " Do me baby, keep quiet. Let 's go inside. " <p> " No " I stamped. " If I ca n't play at least I can watch. " <p> " Come away from there. It 's too dangerous. There are rules, you know. Try to make things different and you 'll lose everything. That 's rule number one. " <p> " Are you my real mother " I asked her the next day. <p> " What a crosses this " Mama said. I asked again, but she just shut up her mouth, pam, and looked far away. <p> " Where 's my real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her side. <p> " Alright since you so force ripe, I going tell you. Your mother is dead for defying History. Come. Come I say. Close the door and stay inside. " <p> " Where 's my father? " <p> " Do n't ask me no more question child. He leave you this big house to live in. He send money every month. What more you want than that? What a trial, what a crosses this child bring down on me, today. " <p> " Where 's my father? " <p> " Alright. Since you so inquisitive, since you so fast and so womanish, since you want the truth so bad I going give you what you deserve. Your father is History, himself. " <p> At the same time, a woman was passing on the road below. She sang : <p> pre " Peel head Jancrow sit up a tree topPick off di blossom.Let me hold you hand gal.Let me hold you hand. " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be safe and Mama would laugh and be strong and everything would be alright. <p> Well I stayed in that house for a time. Every day I sang my songs with a voice clear like river water. Mama would smile and rock to the beat. People passing would hear and stand still as ghosts on the road below. But my mind had already gone from that house. Its emptiness cramped me like a cell. It pressed on my throat like a chain. Only the gardens felt safe to me. I prowled the paths like a cat, tearing out the weeds and chopping back the vines. Night blooming jasmine scented the air. There was desert flower and there was a cactus that bloomed at midnight. There were bohinia and surprise bourganvillea. <p> One night in the rainy season I ran away from the yard, dressed up just like a boy. I hid out my first night in a bus shell, near to a tourist town. My teeth chattered from fear, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I perched up watching, but in the morning I was fine. I must have got a little too boasty though for the next night some men stopped me on the road. <p> " Where you going? " they said. " This road not yours to walk. Go home to you big yard. That 's where you belong. " <p> " Tell History, from me " I said " I not playing his game. " <p> They pulled off my disguise then, laughing so hard they could hardly stand up. But they only scratched my throat with the ratchet blade. Blood dulled the knife 's silver edged glint. <p> " History say you can take you chances, but you ca n't hide " one said " your skin glitters bright in the dark. We can sight you anywhere you go. " <p> " I 'll zip out of it. " I said " there 's an opening between my legs. " They only laughed more. <p> Well I did. Unzipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kite. But I had no form, unnamed, nameless, invisible, I floated over the landscape of burnt cane, over the all-inclusives and their swimming pools, over the markets and the stalls of jerk chicken. I looked down on everything. I was hungry but I could n't eat. I was tired but I could n't sleep. I was vulgar-abstract. No context at all. It was like being trapped in a dream. " History " I thought, " you win this first round. " <p> A woman was sweeping the street. She had a cast eye, but her body was wiry and hard. I knew she had courage if that means nothing to lose. " Catch me in a bottle and I 'll come down " I entered her vision. " What you going gim me " she said hissing her teeth like snake. " I 'll give you my dreams. " <p> " Dream? " she steuptsed. " Dream can build house? " <p> I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she laughed " but you funny and I like to laugh. " <p> She brought me down and hid me and I lived in her board house near the train tracks. On her dresser she kept the bible, a big pink comb and a leaf of sinka bible. We did n't eat much. I taught her my songs and she showed me tricks I could use in a fight. At night we slept in a bed of rags scented with khus khus, her arm around me like a shield. I called her Vida for she was the first life I knew. <p> One day, there was money on the counter and fancy linen on the bed. She said " You mean all this time you have you big house and you do n't say not one word. Imagine. I never know is so you stay and I struggling like hell to keep body and soul together. " I thought " Time to go. " <p> " You ca n't just walk out like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman, after all and we would have to fight. I slipped her through the back, but History 's posse was in the yard. <p> " Dutty gal. Sodomite gal " A red eye one said " You nothing more than a mule. Get back inside. I 'm the Don Gorgan, here. This is my territory. You ca n't negotiate. " <p> " Slip him like I showed you, idiot, " Vida shouted. <p> " Shut up you two mouthed bitch " I screamed, but I was scared to rass. I froze to the spot and the pi-pi ran down my legs. The red-eye one laughed '. He pulled out his teeth and scattered them on the ground. They bloomed like the sweet jasmine I 'd left behind. I wanted my old house and Mama. I wanted to close the door. I longed for a glimpse of the sea and the white road below. <p> " You ca n't even go back to your risto yard.. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. You ca n't do nothing. You no have no use, wondering like a crazy white neager. " I wanted to clothe myself in my songs, wrap myself in a sheath of pure sound. I opened my mouth, but not a single note came out. Not a sound. Silence. <p> Then a man who they said was History himself came in. He was a greyish man in a greyish suit, but I could n't get a look at the face. I would n't know him if I saw him again. The thing is : I could n't struggle, you hear. My body was too heavy with fright. I remember that he said : a lesson is a lesson and if I 'd learned mine and done mine I 'd have been alright. He said " You pass your place, girl. " <p> When I came to, I was somewhere dark and stink like a jail. My body was twisted and swollen and it felt hot and cold, hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed " for I 'm all alone and I do n't even know how to fight. Mama was right. I should n't have tried to get free. " <p> I lay there at the curve of a white darkness -- in the middle of that hot and cold bleeding. A woman like someone in a dream came in. Maybe I made her up ; maybe she was real. I have no memory of how she looked, I only remember the swish of her skirts and that she brought a cup of something to drink. <p> I said " Call History. Tell him I 'll do whatever he wants. " <p> " Which History you want me to call? Is plenty of them out there. " <p> " Call the one that put me here. " <p> " O is him you want. But do n't is him lick you down? What you want with him again? You do n't learn nothing yet? " <p> " He stole my songs. " I muttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Chuh " she said then. " You worrying bout some ole songs? How much time you sing them already? You soon memba them man. " Then she whispered : " If you want to get out of here, make the sounds like how you feel. They might not sound lovely but they will ease your heart. " She left and closed that heavy door. <p> I cried then, softly at first and then loud and horrible, tearing the night in half. I bawled for my mother who had left me. I sobbed for my father trapped in his cruelty. I bawled for my fraidy puss Mama. I cried for the garden swallowed up with bush and weeds. I cried for the blood and the death I had seen. I bawled for my lost songs and for Vida. But most of all I cried for myself. I drank eyewater for breakfast lunch and dinner. I cussed everything and hit myself against the wall. Sometimes I just stared into the darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried till my tongue stuck to my mouth and my eyes were swollen shut. <p> Then the sky grew bright, like a pastel pallet outside the bars on the window. It was magenta and grey and blue over the mountains and the moon smiled out on the dew and the sunrise. A mawga dog barked at the roadside. Between some old newspaper and a rusty tin can blown against the lamp post, two grass quits did a little dance on the ground. There were women selling and mini busses crowded with people making noise and going up and down. The door opened a little then and a thin bright ledge stretched out. " Go on quick " said the woman 's voice and I crawled outside. In the fresh air I felt dizzy. But I stood up straight all the same, brushed off my dirty clothes and headed out for the open road. <p> <p> By Honor Ford-Smith <p>
