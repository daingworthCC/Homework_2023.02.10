4166041 cabin # THERE ARE NO SECRETS IN SMALL HOUSES. The children, Mark and Hazel, knew things were wrong long before their parents admitted it. Before the seething quiet, before their father started sleeping on the couch, before their mother 's humor boiled away, leaving her reduced, thick, and bitter. # A sticky patch divided the table between them. A smear of Mark 's jam, or maybe Hazel 's syrup. The children had pancakes that morning, wolfing them down and running outside like feral cats. Bruce 's arm bent at an odd angle to avoid the spot as he reached across the table to touch Ellen 's hand. " Everything is okay, " he said. # Ellen stared at the mole on Bruce 's arm. It had never bothered her before, but now it seemed sinister, like a sign of underlying pollution become manifest. A message she had ignored. # " Everything is okay, " he repeated, touching her fingers, cold and still. # She stared at the mole. The hair on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark 's stomp on the porch, heavy for such a small boy, and Ellen startled. Mark pushed open the front door a crack and shouted, " We 're gon na ride bikes. " He closed the door and stomped away. # Bruce clasped her hand and pulled it closer, sweeping Ellen 's arm into the sticky spot. She jerked away sharply and rubbed at the smear on her elbow, tipping her head to listen for the children outside. # " They do n't know, " Bruce said. " They did n't even notice. " # Ellen met his eyes. " And that 's all that matters? " she asked flatly. # It began in the summer, the secretive dour restlessness of their parents, so the children spent as much time outside as possible. They probably would have done so anyway but for the animal shadow always outside, lurking. The children avoided the bad luck of speaking about it aloud. They never mentioned him to their parents. Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was preferable to being inside. # Hazel was nine, Mark six. They both had bicycles. Hazel 's bicycle was a Miss America model : pink frame, pink banana seat, red, white, and blue streamers hanging from the handle grips. Mark rode a black-and-yellow Huffy. The Huffy did not have a motif, superhero or otherwise, but Mark had given it a secret name and valued it highly. # Mark, riding alone, would turn endless wobbling circles without leaving the gravel driveway. But Hazel was adventurous and led him farther afield. They followed a circuit : first coasting down the driveway until they were hidden from their house by the dense forest and then pedaling furiously to the first turn at the bottom of the hill. Right led past their few neighbors and up to the paved road into town. Left led onto the back road that wound into the state park before becoming a trail and ending at the sea. They almost always turned left. # Ellen took an early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low when he called Cherise. " No, " he whispered. " I ca n't see you today. " The phone was mounted to the wall by the front door, next to the window. Bruce 's breath steamed the pane as he listened, staring out into the tangled forest surrounding their house. " No. I said I ca n't. It 's impossible. " He lifted a finger and drew the shape of a cabin in the steam and then drew a circle close around it. " I do n't know. " He made a fist and wiped the doodle away with the flesh of his compressed palm. " Well, " he said, glancing back at the door closed between him and his wife, " maybe for just a bit, if it 's soon. " Through the window he saw a dark shape moving through the forest. Reddish brown, a flash of white. Not a bear. He could n't make it out, and it flickered back into shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up, setting the phone back carefully, as though defusing a bomb. # The bedroom door opened and Ellen stumbled out. " You sonofabitch, " she said, pointing. " You were n't gon na. " Her face was flushed and her hair was flattened and matted with spit on one side. " You were n't gonna. " # Bruce turned away from her, pulling on his boots, grabbing his jacket, opening the door. " You 're drunk, " he said, closing the door behind him. # They left their bikes where the narrow trail became too knotted with twisting bulks of spruce root to ride any farther. Hazel walked ahead while Mark dawdled, picking salmonberries and eating them from the bushes without checking for worms. " Gross, " said Hazel. " The worms will crawl out through your skin. " Mark shrugged. His nose ran and he sniffed loudly, licking his upper lip. " Gross, " repeated Hazel, striding well ahead. Through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach below the distant cliffs, and then ebb, sucking between the barnacles like teeth. # " Haze? " said Mark, suddenly anxious. Something massive moved in the thicket of devil 's club beyond, snapping branches. The heavy rub of an animal threading through the brush. " Hey, Haze, wait up. " # She stopped. " Well c'm on then. " He ran to her, dropping the salmonberries from his hand. # They followed the main trail, ignoring its looping side branches that led nowhere in particular, until it opened free of the forest and ended at the crest of a bluff above Mill Bay. The surf broke high and white on the rocks below them. On the promontory sat a small cement-walled pillbox, a derelict bunker left from the island 's World War II defenses. The dank inside was cluttered with beer cans, junk food wrappers, and an inexplicable single, laceless leather boot. A stained mattress slumped in a corner. The mildewed walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaping doorway to see if anything had changed and then climbed to the roof, which was carpeted with soft emerald moss and sprouting grass. They avoided the sagging middle and stood on the firm front edge. Behind them pressed the forest and before them spread the North Pacific, the gray roilings of the Gulf of Alaska. " From here we can see everything, " said Hazel, waving her arms at the curving horizon as though she had created everything by magic herself alone. She always said it, and Mark always nodded, though it did n't seem that they could see anything at all. # Bruce drove to town but stopped only to get gas and call Cherise to cancel from the station 's crusted payphone. Denny Martin stood at the other pump, and they nodded as the gas clicked in. " How 's the family? " asked Denny. " Good, good, " said Bruce, nodding. He paid for the gas and bought a pack of gum and a bottle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat and unwrapped the foil from five sticks of gum. He chewed them together like it was his job, until his jaw groaned and popped from the effort. Driving back the two miles along the coast he could have seen his children atop the pillbox if he was looking, if he could have seen so far. # Bruce parked the truck and stalked through their small house with a black garbage bag, hunting for hidden bottles and dropping them each with a clink into the rustling plastic. He wet a washcloth with warm water and took it together with the soda into the bedroom where Ellen still lay diminished in the tangled blankets. He sat on the bed and wiped her face, brushing back the stray wet hairs, tucking them behind her ears. " I ended it, " he said. " It 's over. " He opened the hissing soda and she raised her head to drink. # " And that 's all that matters? " she repeated. # Mark built a house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hazel grew restless and wanted to move on. Crawling down from the roof was trickier than climbing up to it. They lowered themselves backward, sliding their bellies tight against the black slime of the cement wall, until their feet touched a low shelf-like outcropping of the building. Hazel went first and then guided Mark down, holding his legs. They brushed absently at their clothes, but the slime left wet smears that stained. # They followed the trail back to where they had left their bikes. Hazel noticed the green leaves of a twisted stalk plant, and they knelt to eat its watery berries that tasted vaguely like melon. The flat gray sky above them, barely visible beneath the arching colander of spruce trees, began to drizzle, and the air turned cold and quiet. Mark sniffled and caught a scurrying ground beetle in his palm, showing it to Hazel who nodded gravely. When they had eaten all the ripe berries, they stood and wandered easily down the trail, through the tunneled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know, " said Hazel as they approached their bikes, " if you carve something into an apple tree, and then eat one of the apples, that thing will happen to you. " # " What sort of something? " asked Mark. # " Anything. A wish. Everything. " # " Oh, " said Mark. " We do n't have any apple trees here. " # " I know, " said Hazel. # " What about other trees? " Mark pointed into the forest. # " They 're no good, " said Hazel, shaking her head. # " What about salmonberries? " Mark persisted. # " Salmonberries just grow, " said Hazel. " They do n't mean anything. " # Hazel walked ahead a few steps, but Mark had stopped. She turned and saw him staring into the forest. He stood transfixed and pale. # " What? " Hazel asked. " What is it? " # " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not twenty feet away, the rust-colored fur, the huge head with curving horns, the rolling black eyes gazing back at him. The figure seemed unreal until it made a sound like a moaning cough ending in an explosive snort. # Hazel shouted, snatching at Mark 's arm before turning and racing down the trail. Mark followed, and they ran like chased ducks, shrieking. The young bull ambled out of the bracken and stepped onto the trail. It trotted behind the children, its skin rippling with the easy movement. # Hazel reached her bike first. She slung her leg over the seat as she lifted it from the ground and was pedaling before Mark had even made it to the road. He gripped the handlebars of his Huffy and pushed it a few steps to gather speed before jumping on. Behind them, the bull 's trot shifted into a canter. He charged out of the forest and onto the road, pounding the dirt beneath him, closing the distance to Mark. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machine wobbling and he lost control, pitching headfirst into the ditch beside the road as the animal thundered past. Hazel pedaled ahead, outdistancing the bull. It abandoned his sprint and stood triumphant and snorting in the road for a moment before turning back into the forest and vanishing into the murk. # When the bull was gone, Hazel looped back and helped Mark untangle himself from his bike. He was scraped and crying and muddy, more shaken than wounded. Hazel brushed him off and soothed him. He left his bike in the ditch and walked stiffly with Hazel as she pushed her bike alongside. After a time he mastered his breathing and the ragged sobs subsided. They did n't speak. # Bruce stood on the porch, dumping the clanking garbage bag of bottles into the trash barrel when Mark and Hazel came up the drive. He watched them, his bedraggled children, soaked and dirty and distant from him. He called to Mark. " Where 's your bike? " Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His daughter looked at her brother nervously. " Where 's his bike? " Bruce repeated. # " We left it, " said Hazel. # " Well then go back and get it, " said Bruce. Mark looked startled and Hazel nodded. She leaned her bike against the woodpile and turned back down the driveway. # " No, " said Bruce. " Mark has to go back and get his own bike. Not you. " He focused on Mark, standing aimless and apart. " You go get your bike. You wanted a bike. You have to learn to take care of it. Okay? " Mark nodded slowly. " Do n't just leave it somewhere to rust or get stolen. " Mark nodded again but stood rooted. " Well hustle, or you 'll miss dinner. Hazel, get inside and help your mother. " Bruce waved his hand at her, beckoning impatiently. " You 've been gone all day. Where the hell do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back down the driveway into the tunnel of the trees and then stepped up onto the porch. " Nowhere, " she said. # Walking back to the ditch Mark took small steps and breathed shallowly and hummed quietly. All of these things made him tiny, nearly invisible. But having to touch something, even his bike, was too much. He could not retrieve it. The action would expose him to every lurking thing. He stood unmoving, stuck. His stillness was a thin film, and the least movement through it to the physical world would shatter it, loudly. A three-toed woodpecker hammered on a dying spruce, slapping away the dry bark with blinking flicks of its head. The sound warped and echoed strangely in Mark 's ears, as though he was listening from inside a locked room and someone was knocking to get in. His hands turned blue in the chill, but he could not move them even to put them inside his pockets. His breath slowed and his blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his bike, in a hibernation of panic. The woodpecker moved to a tree above the ditch and knocked again. Mark startled, then turned and ran. # Hazel passed by the kitchen on her way to the bedroom she shared with Mark. She saw her mother 's flushed and blurry face and did not pause to talk. She closed the bedroom door and squatted next to her bed. In a Tupperware bowl wedged behind her nightstand was a cache of stolen things that she kept for comfort : a yellow plastic lighter, a single turquoise earring, a leather key fob, a refrigerator magnet, a withered corsage. It also held food swiped from the pantry during the night. She crammed several stale saltine crackers into her mouth and chewed, catching the crumbs in her cupped hands. She threw the crumbs in a far corner and stashed the bowl away carefully, then sat on the bed, running her tongue around her teeth to clear away the clinging remnants of cracker, listening for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front door open over the roar of the faucet as she washed the dishes. It was the worst time of day, when she felt queasy and disjointed and at sea. Every task required the utmost concentration, lest she stumble, or drop, or spill, and call shame down upon herself. The oven 's preheat light clicked off, and she dried her hands and saw that Mark had seated himself at the kitchen table. He sat with his hands in his lap, staring out the window at the darkening forest. # " Dinner 's not for a while yet, " she told him. He shrugged. She asked him where Hazel was, and he shrugged again. She opened four chicken pot pie boxes and slid the pies into the oven. " You can set the table, " she said. # Mark slid off the chair and padded over to the silverware drawer. # " You get it? " Bruce 's voice came from the other room. Mark looked blankly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get your bike? " Bruce repeated. # " He says no, " said Ellen, shouting back, wincing. # Bruce stuck his head into the kitchen and glowered at Mark. " Why not? " # Mark shrugged and stared at the floor, picking at his jeans. " He can get it later, " said Ellen. " I told him to help me with dinner. " Ellen noticed for the first time Mark 's smeared clothes, that his face was grubby with dirt and dried tears. " What happened to you? " she asked. # " I fell, " said Mark. She examined his elbows, decided that the scrapes would heal on their own, and told him to go wash. # At dinner, Bruce sat at the head of the table, facing the picture window as Ellen skidded a hot pie on each plate in turn. Hazel picked the burnt edges of crust off of hers with a show of annoyance. Bruce noticed and began to scold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark kept silent. He had reached a decision and the effort of suppressing it left him unable to speak. He was going to say that he had been scared. That he could n't get the bike because he was scared, but he could not form his mouth around the words. Ellen left the oven door ajar to add its dying heat to the cold room and sat down heavily. # Bruce stiffened. " What the hell is that? " he asked. He pointed out the window at a dark reddish shadow moving through the bushes. " That 's the same thing I saw earlier, " he said. Ellen and the children twisted in their seats to look. Mark gasped and Hazel started mumbling something under her breath. # " It 's Hodge 's bull, " said Ellen. " It gets out sometimes. I 've seen it in the yard, just wandering around. " # " Those goddamn people, " said Bruce. He pushed back from the table and strode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and Bruce knew the number without looking. He dialed, breathing loud. He grunted as he waited for someone to pick up. " Hodge? This is Bruce Salter. Look, your goddamn bull was loose out in the woods today. It 's in my yard right now. That 's dangerous. I 've got kids. You better tie that fucking thing up or I swear to god I 'll shoot it myself. I 'll cut out its sirloin and leave it to rot, you hear me? " He slammed the phone down and turned to his watching family. " He goddamn better, " he said. # They ate in silence, each hunched over their gloomy pie, the meat parts soft and wet. #
