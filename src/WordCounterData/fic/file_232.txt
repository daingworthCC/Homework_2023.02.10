4163141 hangs on the wall of Rocky 's Old-fashioned Po'boy Shop. Inside it, a plastic gator peeks out from a clump of moss. You ca n't take your eyes off of it. " It 's suicide, " Delaware says. " This is our last meal. " He stuffs three inches of his hot sausage po'boy into his mouth. He follows your gaze to the canoe and then returns it to the sandwich. The restaurant is a single room filled with foot ball pads and bulky boys hunched over sand wiches. Due to the lack of space, you 've been relegated to sit at a table for two with the team 's second-string receiver and unofficial waterboy. The whole place smells like an armpit, and no body 's even sweating yet. You open your fried shrimp po'boy and scrape a glob of mayonnaise off the French bread with a plastic knife and wonder why coach thinks it 's a good idea to fill his player 's stomachs with comfort food right before the last game. " I mean... " Delaware pauses to gulp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oily dirty-blond hair from his forehead. " I do n't see why we ca n't just forfeit. If we 're going to lose anyway, we might as well not die in the process. " Orange grease dots the sides of his mouth. Delaware is n't particularly fat, but his body is soft and his face is round and pale. He 's big for a freshman -- almost six-foot. You all thought he 'd be better at football. " At least you do n't have to start. " You put the bread back on your sandwich and lift it to your mouth. A pile of fried shrimp and shredded lettuce tumbles out its backside. Delaware snorts. " True. But if you die tonight -- and you almost definitely will -- I 'm going to be the one taking your place. " " We might have a chance to win, " you say. But you do n't have a chance. In eighth grade Coach offered you a schol arship to play football for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too. He 's a senior this year and the quarterback, and Coach would do anything to get another one of the Benoit boys to play for him. You guess he expects you to grow into your last name. The team improved each year, Coach said. Riverside offered top-notch athletics and academics. And, to top it all off, you 'd be sure to get time on the field. He 'd gotten one thing right : You 're a start ing receiver -- a scrawny, five-foot-seven fresh man starting receiver. The rest were lies. The team sucks, and Riverside Prep is falling apart. It is n't even near the river. You 're just a bunch of boys from the suburbs of New Orleans who play football. The boys on the west side of the river, the boys from Belle Chasse, they 're foot ball players. Delaware stuffs the last greasy heel of French bread into his mouth. A wooden pelican glares at you from the ceiling rafters. Oil bursts from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive hand shoves your head down ward and tousles your hair. " Well, is n't this romantic. " Delaware 's eyes lock on the tablecloth. You twist in your seat to face your cousin. Brett is bigger than you ever expect to be. He has the broad shoulders and angular jaw of someone born to be an athlete. His dark hair swoops to the side the way all the guys wish their hair did, the way that your curls do n't. " Ready for the big game, Garrett? " he says. You shrug. " You better get ready. We 're going to win this one. " The bell above the door jingles, and cool air floods into the restaurant. Brett 's girlfriend Alyssa struts into his arms. She wears skinny jeans and Brett 's oversized football hoodie. Her dark hair pours over her shoulders like a laven der-scented waterfall. She wraps an arm around Brett 's shoulder and cocks her head to the side. Delaware attempts to say hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a nod. " Mr. Miller let me leave early today so I could eat with the team. " Alyssa 's voice is smooth and sweet. She picks at the sleeve of her hoodie. " I can hardly stay awake in that class anyway. " " The other day I fell asleep in Mr. Miller 's American History class, " Delaware says. " I did n't even look awake. I drooled all over the desk. " Brett half smiles and raises an eyebrow. " Cool story. " Alyssa giggles as Delaware 's eyes drop again. A mousy man in a white-collared shirt strolls into Rocky 's, notes the crowd, and retreats. " That happened to me once, " you say. You peel the batter off of a stray shrimp. Under neath, the shrimp is pink and naked and fragile. A n explosion of laughter overtakes the room. Brett glances toward the team 's upperclassmen bunched up at a handful of tables at the other end of the room. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let you finish your sandwich. " They turn and meander toward the rest of the team, stopping here and there so that Alyssa can greet everyone. When they reach the senior table, the team engulfs them. Arms flail in an imated discussion, and someone knocks over a can of Sprite. Delaware recounts a dream he had the night before involving zombies and dirty socks. He is convinced that it foretells your imminent deaths. From the mounted pirogue, the plastic alligator grins with a mouthful of sharp, white teeth. Your grandparents lived in Belle Chasse before they moved into a shotgun house in New Orleans so that they could be closer to every one. Once a month your parents drove you across the river and dropped you off at Mawmaw and Paw-paw 's house. They lived in a cozy home with a wrap-around porch. A live oak grew in front of the house, and its dark branches snaked out over the yard. Waxy leaves blocked the sunlight so that even in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isted in twilight. Maw-maw liked to decorate the house for each season, and she especially enjoyed Hal loween. One year, when Halloween fell on a weekend, she convinced all of her grandchil dren to spend the night at her house. You were nine then, the second youngest after your little sister, Maggie, who was only five. A t fourteen, Brett assumed his place as the eldest and most knowledgeable of the cousins. He had almost finished middle school. And what more did a person need to know after Pre-Algebra? The other cousins -- Sara, Jessica, and Charlie -- usually followed Brett, although every now and then the older girls would declare him gross and shut themselves into a guest bedroom to do whatever preteen girls do for fun. On that Halloween, though, the house groaned and creaked, and even the guestroom could n't be trusted not to harbor ghosts. Maggie had thrown a fit in the middle of Killer Klowns from Outer Space, and Maw-maw took her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not, in reality, man-eating. Paw-paw had fallen asleep on the recliner with a bowl of candy on his lap, in case any local children came to trick-or-treat. They rarely did in that sleepy neighborhood. You huddled in the kitchen with your older cousins. They spoke in whispers. " The only strength is in numbers. " Brett glanced around the bright room, his blue eyes wide. You turned to where Sara and Charlie stood behind you, but they had vanished. " Where did they go? " you said. Jessica clasped her hands to her cheeks. She still wore her witch costume, and her black skirt swished as she searched the kitchen with exaggerated diligence. Glitter from her pointy hat dusted the floor with every gesture. She opened the cabinet beneath the sink and peered inside. She found only murky pipes and cleaning chemicals. " They 're gone, " Brett said. You scanned the room for possible hiding places. Darkness from the far ends of the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrible, unseen things that a kitchen 's worth of light could not protect you from. " Quit it guys. " You shuffled toward the cor ner of the room where nothing could sneak up on you. Tonight you were Batman, complete with a utility belt and plastic Batman abs. " Scared? " Brett said. A musical clock in the den chimed an eerie melody. Midnight. He stroked an imaginary beard. " I know where they are. " " You do n't think they 're there, do you? " Jes sica said. " That 's exactly what I think. " Brett grabbed the flashlight and marched to the front door. You squeezed in between him and Jessica. " We 're going outside? " " What, are you scared? " Brett grinned. " Are you? " Cold air washed over you as Brett flung the door open. You shivered and hugged your arms. Brett plodded into the front yard and onto the road. The streetlights stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely gave off any light. Brett clicked the flashlight on. " Guys, I 'm serious, where 'd they go? " You adjusted your plastic mask. The places where it touched your face were tender and sticky with sweat. Jessica 's teeth chattered behind you as you followed Brett down the street. " They were taken... " Brett walked back wards and angled the flashlight beam onto his face. " By the Loup-garou. " " That 's what I thought, " Jessica said. " The what? " " The Loup-garou. The swamp monster. " Brett loomed over you, the flashlight rays dis torting his face. He grinned like the Cheshire Cat. " It was a man once but now it has a wolf 's head. On nights like this it steals children away from their homes, drags them back to the swamp, and eats them. " He licked his lips. Brett stopped at a clearing between two or nate homes with Grecian columns and porch swings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on this part of the street, and only a single porch light shone from one of the miniature chateaus. A t the far side of the clear ing, a live oak grew like your grandmother 's. Many of its branches dipped low to the ground, and Spanish moss hung from the spidery limbs, swaying in the gentle breeze. " They 're back behind that tree. " Brett turned to face you. " T hat 's where it takes the children. " " I thought you said it takes them to the swamp, " you said. Jessica crept up next to you. " It takes them here to tie them up before it leaves. " " Liars. " " Well, then go see. " Brett shoved you for ward with the backside of the flashlight. " You go see, " you said. Brett crossed his arms. " You 're the one who does n't believe me. Or are you scared? " You narrowed your eyes and stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky covered up the stars and the moon. As you ap proached, oak branches writhed overhead like the shadows of living things. A twig popped be hind the trunk, and your skin prickled under your plastic armor. You took another step onto one of the knotted roots. Sneakers scuffed against pavement behind you. You turned back to an empty asphalt road. Something grabbed your forearm. You spun to face the creature. Its eyes glowed red and its hands dripped something dark. It hardly had time to growl at you before you shook off its grip. You pushed off of the root and fled, each row of dark houses blurring into the next. The cold air filled your lungs and pierced your throat. Your arms pumped at your sides as your Batman cape billowed behind you. The sound of your breath, trapped within the plastic mask, filled your ears and skull. Soon you stood in front of your grandpar ent 's house, your head spinning, chest heaving. Leaves rustled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the backyard. The motion-detecting porch light clicked on. Jessica leaned against Maw-maw 's oak and grinned. Brett stood at the front door of the house, shak ing with silent laughter. T h e sky stretches over Belle Chasse Chris tian 's football field in brilliant shades of pink and blue. A t sunset, the lights already outshine the nearly full moon as if this football field were the center of the universe. Coach directs the team to warm up -- a light jog and then a run at three-quarters speed. On the other side of the field, two members of Belle Chasse 's team toss a ball back and forth. The rest lounge around their water cooler. Brett motions for the team to follow him in a jog. The cool November air burns your lungs. You welcome it into the stuffy prison of your helmet and between the fibers of your jersey. You smell your own sweat already pooling onto your itchy chin strap and the sweat of those who wore your helmet before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you increase to what you suspect is three-quarters speed. You round the corner of the field. Parents and a handful of supportive students trickle into the visitors ' side of the bleachers. The Belle Chasse band warms up with a mediocre per formance of " Smoke on the Water. " You finish your laps and trot back to the end zone, where coach holds his clipboard. You 're the first one back, but others soon follow. Delaware contin ues running his awkward, flat-footed gallop. He passes the end zone and takes another lap. Brett groans, and some other seniors begin making catcalls. Delaware picks up his pace. So much for three-quarters speed. Delaware 's name is n't really Delaware. It 's Christopher Clarke. Or Chris. And when he came to Riverside he asked to be called by his middle name, James. But it did n't matter what his name was or what he wanted his name to be. He 'd butted into a conversation with the upperclassmen that first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his favorite movies. And somewhere along the way, he in formed everyone that he was born in Delaware. That he 'd left when he was three, but he 'd al ways thought of Delaware as his " one true home. " He described in great detail memories of his home state that he could n't possibly re member. He spoke with such passion that you could n't blame Brett for laughing and saying, " Oh, that sounds just lovely. " Christopher Clarke blabbed on. " Right, it is lovely. And in the fall the leaves turn such amazing colors. There 's, like, actually seasons, you know? Like sometimes you just want to sit and look at the leaves and just hear the sounds they make when the wind blows. " " Oh, wow. I bet you get really homesick, " Brett said. " I really do. " After that, the seniors bestowed Christo pher with his new name. Now, Delaware slows his pace. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his gold football pants just a little. W hen he joins the team, he raises his arms onto his hel met to catch his breath. " Coach, " Number 53 says, " where 's the water? " Coach swivels around and scans the side lines. He lifts his baseball cap and rubs his bald ing head. He 's not a tall man, and his round belly pokes out as if he 's stuffed a beach ball under his shirt. His face colors as his bushy eye brows knit together. " Clarke, where 's the water? " Delaware 's arms flop down from his head. The Belle Chasse team lines up to stretch. He removes his helmet and shrugs. Coach grunts. " Did it get on the bus? " " I did n't see it, " Number 2 says. Coach turns to Delaware. " Do you think you can earn a place on this team by being lazy? " Delaware digs the front of his cleat into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to get water, turns away, and directs the rest of the team to stretch. Brett and two other seniors stand in front of the rest of you and lead the counting. You all bend and touch your toes. Delaware does n't bend. He stands off to the side, his arms dangling, and slinks away from the team. Your muscles tighten and burn as you stretch. The field smells of grass and concession stand burgers. More students gather in the bleachers, and cheerleaders congregate on the racing track around the field. The orange dirt crunches as they arrange themselves. They pick up their red and gold pom-poms and practice a cheer. W hen you finish stretching, the team gath ers around Coach to run through the plays one more time. The team rarely completes a play. The game plan generally evolves into some thing more basic : Keep the other team from winning by more than fifty points, do n't fumble, protect the quarterback, and for God 's sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The players continue chatting. Most of the larger players recline on their bench while the coach huddles with the smaller guys. Delaware raises a hand and catches their attention. One of the bulky players turns to face him. The player interrupts Belle Chasse 's huddle and gives Delaware a thumbs up. Delaware picks up one of their water coolers and waddles back to the bench. He plops it down next to the first aid kit. The team takes a water break. You join Delaware on the bench. " They 're really nice, " he says. " They just let me take it. " Number 53 approaches. His name is Corey. He spent a day at the Saints training camp a couple of summers ago, and now he acts like he 's elite. " Dude, did n't you get some cups or something? " Delaware slumps. His pasty cheeks flush. Brett lies on the ground while Number 2 -- Eric -- tips the nozzle of the cooler toward his mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Eric accidentally spills some on Brett 's jersey. Brett fills his mouth with icy water and spits it at Eric 's face. It runs off of his neck and into his jersey. " I hate this school, " Delaware says. You shrug. " It 's school. " " Four years and I 'm gone. I 'm going north where the trees change colors. There are actu ally seasons there. " You rip a piece of grass from the ground and tear it to shreds. He angles away from Brett and the other seniors. " Do those guys actually think they 're any good? They 're not going anywhere. They act like they 're special, but tomorrow football will be over and they 'll be nobody. " " Dude, calm down, " you say. His voice loses some of its heat. " W hat are you going to do? " " When? " " In four years. " " I do n't know. I have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to die tonight anyway, right? " He chuckles. " I forgot about that. " The referee calls captains to the fifty yard line for the coin toss. The sun dips below the horizon and the field lights hover above every one like a UFO preparing to abduct. The Belle Chasse crowd puts your fans to shame. They are a spirited mass of blue and orange. The patchy Riverside fans are n't even looking at the field. They talk among themselves, probably about everything but football. Delaware slaps your pads as you jog into po sition. You 're on offense first. The Belle Chasse players are about the same size as you. Many have scrawny limbs and boyish faces. Their kicker boots the ball. It wobbles into the air and peaks, momentarily shrouded in the field lights ' glare. T h e score is 10-7 and the Riverside crowd has perked up. Most of the game, you were be hind by ten points. No one would go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been sent home in an ambulance. No one had made a complete fool out of himself. It would have been a respectable loss. But then there was the touchdown in the beginning of the fourth quar ter. You caught the ball in the end zone and the crowd roared. It was a beautiful pass from Brett that fell into your arms. You had n't done a thing. For a moment the players stood stiff, hands open and ready to celebrate, but unwill ing to cheer before the referee signaled the touchdown. He did. The whole team went air borne at once, even the players on the bench. It 's the end of the fourth, and Belle Chasse 's starters have taken the field to clean up after their rookies. Number 26 prepares for a field goal. If he makes it, you will tie and go into overtime. " Let 's go, two six, " you say. No one can hear you, but you say it all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, but you pray for the ball to veer right or left and save you from overtime. Coach will yell, and then say he 's proud of the progress you 've made this season, and then you will go home. You might convince your parents to stop for a cheeseburger on the way back. And just like that the game ends. The ball veers left. Two runts from the home team chest bump on the sideline. You suspect they 've never gotten to play in a varsity game before. Corey flings his helmet down. He 's crying, and you look away. You line up to congratulate Belle Chasse, remove your helmet, and retire to the bench. Delaware sits next to you. " We were so close. " " Yeah. " " And you made a touchdown. " He smiles. " Awesome. " Brett strolls up to the bench with his hel met in his right hand. His hair is plastered to his forehead and sticks up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grin remains. He high-fives you. " Nice job, Garret. " " You did most of the work, " you say. " It takes two to tango, " he says. You grimace. One of the Belle Chasse play ers sneaks behind the bench and drags the water cooler away. " Are you going home on the bus? " Brett says. A rogue snare strikes a beat as the band packs up and the fans disperse. " I 'm going back with my parents, " you say. " You have clothes to change into? " You nod and pat the duffel bag at your feet. " Drive back with me and Alyssa. To cele brate our touchdown. " He glances at Delaware who has become interested in his shoelaces. " You come too. " " I 'll ask my parents, " you say. " They 'll be cool. " He runs his fingers through his hair and looks back at the bleach ers. " I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his admirers. " You do n't have to go, " you say to Delaware. " You do n't want me to go? " " It 's not that. " You pull your cleats off and fish your sneakers out of the duffel bag. " I want to. " He picks up his cell phone from the bench and sends a text. " My folks wo n't mind, " he says between clicks. You nod and fol low Brett to the bleachers. You end up crammed into the middle seat of Alyssa ' s SUV between Delaware and Corey. Brett drives and Alyssa talks about how she ca n't believe football season is actually over. You changed into sweatpants and a T-shirt and threw your pads in the back. Delaware did n't bring extra clothes to the game, so he still wears his football pants, cleats, and Under Armour. He smells like wet socks and B.O. and you won der how he can stink so much considering he sat on the bench for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two cheerleaders whisper. O ne of the cheerleaders giggles. Eric pulls a case of beer from the back and asks if you want one. You accept and take a sip. Beer is bit ter and acidic and you 'd always thought it would taste better. " Good boy, " Eric says. He grabs a can for himself and pops open the top. The smells of beer and sweat and the cheerleaders ' flowery perfumes mingle around you. T he car heater is on low and everyone is pressed together. You wish you 'd gone home with your parents and gotten your cheeseburger. You want to sleep away the soreness and a season 's w orth of bruises. But now Brett and Alyssa are talking about your touchdown. She turns and pats your knee. You smile and hope it looks natural. Next to you Delaware shifts his weight. Every now and then the form of a tree or a fire hydrant blurs out the window, but you ca n't make out where you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faded gold as Delaware 's pants. Brett drives down a meandering road along the levee. He turns off into a dimly lit neigh borhood of gaudy houses and miniature planta tions. Brett reaches his arm back for a beer. Eric hooks him up. T he SUV stops in front of a clearing between two white houses. The houses are smaller than you remember and less threat ening. But the clearing is still long, and the oak tree at its far end still erupts from the ground like a many-headed beast. " W hy are we here? " you say. " For old tim e 's sake. " Brett chuckles and chugs the rest of his beer. He pats Alyssa 's thigh. The engine idles. A steady stream of warm air flows from the heater. Brett raises his voice. " W e 've got a new member of the family to initiate tonight. " He turns in his seat to look at Delaware. His breath reeks of beer. " Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " One of the cheerleaders imitates a ghost. Delaware shakes his head. " It 's a swamp monster that feasts on hum an flesh. " Brett hangs on the last word. He points toward the clearing. " A nd it lives behind that tree. " Delaware snorts. " You 're laughing now, man. But I 'm seri ous. " Brett flashes a smile. " W hat does this initiation entail? " Delaware says. The backseat snickers. A cheer leader mimics him in a British accent. " You go to the end of the field, hold your hand on the tree trunk for ten seconds, and then come back, " Brett says. Delaware raises an eyebrow. " T h at 's it? " " T hat 's it. " Delaware shrugs and slips out of the SUV. He pushes the door shut and jogs into the field, no hesitation. Delaware stumbles on the roots, but eventually places his hand on the trunk and holds up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Idiot, " Brett says. In a series of swift mo tions he starts the car and puts it in drive. Delaware does n't have time to count to ten be fore Brett puts his foot on the gas and speeds into the night. The SUV lurches forward and you tip over into Delaware 's spot. His heat still radiates from the pleather seat. " W hat are you doing? " Your voice cracks. " It 's just a little joke, " Brett says. " Are you going back? " " He has a cell phone. H e 'll be fine. " Brett turns the radio on. The SUV pulses with dubstep bass. T he backseat goes wild, thrashing to the electronic beats. Eric taps your shoulder and offers you another beer. You push his hand away. He shrugs and drinks it himself. You glance out the window as Brett turns onto another residential seat. You pass houses and fire hydrants and neat lawns. Street lamps line the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. You can imagine Delaware standing at the oak 's base, shrouded beneath dark branches, all of the color drained from his face. A nd you know that there is no cousin in a wolf mask waiting for him, no one to grab his arm, no house to run back to -- only shadows. Your skull throbs to the rhythm of the radio. " Let me out. " Nothing happens. The car is hot, unbear able. You raise your voice. " Let me out. Now. " Brett stops the SUV and puts it in park. The interior lights fade on as he turns to face you. Brett is n't smiling. Corey raps his fingers against his window. " Come on, man. Chill out. " " It 's only a joke, " Alyssa says in a voice more fragile than glass. " Go back, " you say. Brett turns off the radio. " No. " Eric belches, and one of the cheerleaders shushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow has smudged down to her bottom lids. " Maybe -- " " N o. " Brett reddens in the yellow light. " Are you serious? Are you? " His eyes bulge. You throw the door open. The night air dulls the throbbing pain in your temples. You slide out of the vehicle and slam the door shut. Before you can get your duffel, the SUV hurtles away. The bass beat starts up again and fades as the vehicle disappears around the corner. You stand in the street for a moment. You are alone, surrounded by only quiet suburban homes. You inhale and jog toward the clearing. The world smells like jasmine and freshly cut grass. You increase to three-quarters speed, breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth like Coach taught you. And then you sprint. You bound past porch swings and wind chimes, oak trees and kitchen windows. The air twirls through your hair and stings your cheeks. It enters your lungs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pavement. They carry you back to Delaware and the oak tree. Back to the Loup-garou. AW A Director Eric Maynard inside the Governor Mike Huckabee Delta Rivers Nature Center.
