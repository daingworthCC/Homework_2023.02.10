Some insects spread disease. They can ruin crops and cause famines. <p> N2 : For centuries, we searched for ways to conquer these pesky bugs, but nothing worked. <p> N3 : Until we created DDT. <p> N1 : During World War?, this powerful pesticide was used overseas to stop outbreaks of two deadly diseases : malaria, which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by fleas and lice. Millions of lives were saved. <p> N2 : After the war, American farmers used DDT to prevent bugs from eating their crops. <p> N3 : Parents sprayed their children with DDT. Trucks rumbled through neighborhoods, spraying DDT on schools, pools, and playgrounds. <p> N1 : By 1951, malaria was wiped out in the United States. <p> N2 : People hailed DDT as a miracle. <p> N3 : But it had a dark side. <p> N1 : DDT was killing more than just insects. <p> SCENE 1 <p> A HOT SUNNER DAY IN 1957 <p> N2 : Olga and Stuart Huckins live on a bird sanctuary in Massachusetts. One afternoon, they hear a loud whirring noise. <p> N3 : They see a plane flying low over their land.

Its bill is gaping open.

She has more recently become a famous nature writer. <p> OLGA : Rachel knows people in Washington, D.C. Maybe she can help. <p> SCENE 2 <p> A FARM, 1958 <p> N3 : Rachel has long been worried about the growing use of pesticides like DDT. Olga 's letter is one of many she has received over the years. <p> LETTER 1 : My best horse drank from a trough after DDT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours later. <p> LETTER 2 : My ducklings are hatching with deformities. Many do not hatch at all. <p> LETTER 3 : On a hunting trip, I sprayed my tent with DDT for 21 nights. By the time I got home, I was so sick I had to have 41 blood infusions. Now I have tenninal cancer. <p> N1 : Rachel is so disturbed that she decides to investigate. She talks to biologists, insect and bird experts, and doctors all over the country. <p> N2 : One day, she visits a farm. <p> MR.

Since then, not a single pig has been born alive. <p> N1 : That night in her hotel, Rachel is listening to the radio. A commercial comes on. <p> ACTOR 1 : Today, everyone can enjoy comfort, health, and safety through the insect-killing powers of DDT. <p> ACTOR 2 : DDT is a benefactor for all humanity. Bigger apples, juicier fruits - all free from unsightly worms. <p> ACTOR 1 : Your cows will produce up to 20 percent more milk... <p> ACTOR 2 :... and your steers will gain 50 pounds when you get rid of pests with... <p> ACTORS 1 &; 2( in unison) :... our DDT products! <p> N2 : Rachel turns off the radio. <p> RACHEL( to herself) ; I am going to do something about this. <p> SCENE 3 <p> RACHEL 'S HOUSE, NARYLAND, I960 <p> N3 : For the next two years, Rachel immerses herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respected scientists. <p> SCIENTIST 1 : In places where pesticides are sprayed heavily, large numbers of birds are dying. The birds are eating the poisoned insects and getting poisoned themselves. <p> SCIENTIST 2 : DDT is getting into the water. It 's contaminating the milk we drink. People are getting sick. <p> SCIENTIST 1 : DDT causes cancer. It 's also causing birth defects in animals - and in people. <p> N1 : Rachel is shocked by her findings. She decides to write a book about the dangers of DDT and other pesticides. She talks to her agent. <p> NARIE : I have a publisher very interested in this book. <p> RACHEL : This story is going to be more terrible than I imagined. DDT is supposed to kill just pests. But it affects everything. Our entire ecosystem is at risk. <p> MARIE : You 've always said that nature is interconnected. <p> RACHEL : I had such a haunting nightmare last night. <p> MARIE : What was it? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of spring. Except there are no chirping birds or flowers or bushes or trees. No people and no children. Nothing lives. The stores are empty. The playgrounds are empty. The streams and rivers have no fish. Eveiything is quiet. Utter silence. Dead silence. <p> MARIE : I think we have the title of your book- Silent Spring. <p> SCENE 4 <p> RACHEL 'S COTTAGE, NAINE, 1961 <p> N2 : Rachel is deep into writing her book when she gets devastating news : She has breast cancer. <p> N3 : As Rachel grows sicker, she struggles with the heaps of information she has collected. <p> JEANNE : You ca n't keep this up, Rachel. You need to rest. <p> RACHEL : I just need help organizing all of this data. <p> JEANNE : Of course, I will help you. What are all these new studies? <p> RACHEL : They came to me from an old colleague at the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries. He sent them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that DDT is harmful. <p> JEANNE : This is too much. Are you sure you can manage all of this? <p> RACHEL : I wont rest until this book is done. IfI do nothing more in my life, I must tell this story. <p> N1 : Jeanne does all she can to help. In addition to assisting with research, Jeanne also helps Rachel deal with her illness. She sets up Rachel 's bedroom so she can write from her bed. Rachel spends the next year finishing her book. <p> JEANNE : People are already talking about this book, Rachel. It 's not even out yet. <p> RACHEL : I 've heard. The New Yorker magazine is going to run excerpts. <p> JEANNE : I have a feeling this is going to cause quite a storm. Are you ready for all this? <p> RACHEL : I am ready. <p> SCENE 5 <p> A BOARDROOM, 1962 <p> N2 : Chemical-company executives are outraged. They call a meeting with their key supporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy us. <p> DR. ROBERT WHITE-STEVENS : This woman is a fanatic. She 's not even a scientist. <p> EXECUTIVE 2 : She did train as a marine biologist. The book is thoroughly researched. <p> WHITE-STEVENS : She wants to ban all pesticides. <p> EXECUTIVE 1 : She does n't actually come out and say that. She says we should study their long-term effects before using them mmscriminately. <p> WHITE-STEVENS : Whose side are you on? She 's making us out to be murderers. Does n't she know what the world would be like if it were n't for pesticides? We would return to the Dark Ages, and the insects and diseases and vermin would once again inherit the Earth. <p> EXECUTIVE 2 : We can try to stop her. <p> EXECUTIVE 1 : You 're darned right we can try to stop her! <p> N3 : The chemical industry launches massive campaign to discredit Silent Spring before it even comes out. <p> N1 : Articles criticizing Rachel in journals around the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> N3 : Yet, the chemical compames ' efforts backfire. In fact, they end up generating more publicity for Rachel 's book, which quickly becomes a best-seller. Rachel is flooded with supportive letters from readers. Many people in the scientific community stand behind her. <p> N1 : Rachel 's message had finally been heard. <p> EPILOGUE <p> N2 : After Silent Spring was published, Americans began taking steps to make sure that chemicals were used more carefully in their communities. <p> N3 : President John F. Kennedy read Rachel 's book and ordered his science committee to investigate her claims. In 1972, DDT was banned in the U.S. <p> N1 : Rachel, however, did not live long enough to see the impact her book would have on the world. She died of cancer in 1964, less than two years after Silent Spring was published. <p> N2 : But her legacy lives on through the Environmental Protection Agency( EPA), which was formed in 1970. The EPA 's mission is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and land are safe... <p> N3 :... and to make sure that no spring is ever silent.
