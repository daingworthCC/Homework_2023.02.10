1016741 " Tell me. What do you see when you look out there? All around you? " <p> " I do n't know, I can see tops of buildings. All up and down Market Street. And Broad as far as Soldiers ' Park. And after that the river. " <p> " What else? " <p> " The drawbridge is up. There 's a barge going through. " <p> " And if you look this way? " <p> " Hills. The suburbs. The Oranges, off there. And the other way, New York. " <p> " Okay, you 're a smart boy, a college boy. Rutgers, is it? " <p> " Rutgers Newark. " <p> " Good, so you know this city. You grew up here? " <p> " Up there, sir. " Adams looked toward the rise of suburbs to the west. " Orange Mountain. " <p> " You do n't sound like radio. " <p> " With a mike, I 'm different. " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd go broke. What 'd they teach you in college? " <p> " I studied English. " <p> " Shminglish. See this studio? " He did. It was, for a low-wattage station squeezed up at the very top of the FM band in a dying industrial city, quite a remarkable place. The chairs were leather, the walls were paneled in walnut, the lighting was soft, prints hung on the walls. At the receptionist 's desk, a young woman, her blonde hair cut in a fashionable shag, was reading a paperback. She wore a leather bomber jacket, zipped up, perhaps for shelter from the powerful air-conditioning, which kept the air cold as mint. She was surrounded by a bank of phones and a top quality matte black word processor. There was no paper in the printer 's feeder tray ; the phone lights did n't blink once. This place was unlike any studio, or even any office, that Adams had ever seen. <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You should have seen it when we moved in here. A hovel, all chaos. Wires, boxes, crates, junk everywhere, old food cartons, soda cans, cigarette butts, like it was a fraternity house, not a radio station. You see? " <p> " I did n't know you had your studio up here all these years. " <p> " Of course you did n't, why should you? I do n't want people to stop by, to pay a visit. I 'm not the Newark Museum, see. I 'm in radio. " <p> " To be heard, not seen. " <p> Zlotsky liked that. " Yes. Not seen. And I 'll tell you something else, young man. Not heard, either. That 's how I do things. People who work for me, I do n't want to hear from them, they do n't want to hear from me. If they do, it 's because there 's trouble. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the new on-air promo for WRNJ. Adams realized that the signal had been piped, live, into Zlotsky 's office throughout their interview. He in fact had not heard it. It was perfect background music, rich, synthetic, insinuating itself just below the level of conscious awareness -- doctor ' s-office music, elevator music. <p> Yet if the studio itself were any evidence, Zlotsky seemed to know how to make a profit from a marginal station in a weak market. Adams wondered how the profit could come solely from easy listening. As he looked out the studio window, prompted by Zlotsky 's questions, he could see that, except for the housing projects off in the distance by the highway, there were no more than a half dozen high rises in the city, and there were only two skyscrapers. Most of the buildings were so small that, even if they had music piped into their elevators, you 'd have to ride up and down a few times to hear one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy? " Zlotsky had stepped away from the window, and was now sitting at his desk, leaning back, clipping the end off a fat cigar. <p> " I do n't know if I could play this kind of music. " <p> " Who 's asking you to? I know you ca n't, college. I do n't need you for this, all I need 's an engineer to play this. It 's just cueing tapes. " Zlotsky flicked some ash from his desk top, dismissively, as if to show his general disdain for all of this -- the music, the employees, the station itself. " I want something different midnight to morning, something, well -- what kind of music do you listen to? " <p> " Me? Oh, the usual. Rock ' n ' roll, oldies, blues, jazz, a little Motown... " <p> " Okay, okay, very educated. " <p> " Well, mostly I do n't listen. Mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you to do. But, do me a favor, and this, what do you call it, this Motion? " <p> " Motown. " <p> " Let 's leave that music for the shvartze stations. " <p> " Pardon? " <p> " Do n't get me wrong -- black, white, purple, I do n't care what kind of music people want to listen to in their own homes. But we do n't play music for people to listen to in their homes. " <p> " Even at midnight? " <p> " To tell you the truth, we 've had a lot of success, knock wood, with this particular kind of music. At least during the days. " Zlotsky waved his hand around, as if to point to the air itself, where the soft music seemed to hang suspended, like a mist. " There 's plenty of waiting rooms to play us during the day hours. But not after midnight. All I can tell you is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want our kind of music. " <p> Radio was Adams 's earliest vice. When he was a child, he used to go to bed early, sleep for an hour or two, then shake himself awake and turn on the radio, quiet, so that no one else would know, and he would listen in the dark. He would twist the set and jiggle the antenna to pick up baseball broadcasts in French from Montreal, then a midnight rock station from Buffalo, and then, if he could hold on long enough, early in the morning, he would tune in to the farm reports, clear as the wind, from some unimaginably powerful station on the Iowa prairie. <p> Adams would dream about working in radio, about the peculiar duality, perpetually suspended between intimacy and anonymity, that a radio announcer enjoys. Adams liked to imagine how his amplified voice would sound, rattling the plastic on a cheap transistor or pumped up to full volume on a Chevy dashboard, loud enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice played over a loudspeaker at a roller rink, in a supermarket, or ricocheting at all different angles and volumes from every stanchion in a ball park. He imagined his voice blasting from thousands of portables along a vast patchwork of blankets, as much a recognized part of the Jersey shore as the roiling surf and the smell of hot oil. Most of all, he liked to conjure the image of a girl in tears, a lonely teenager, spurned by a boyfriend or, worse, unnoticed by the boy of her dreams, curled up on a sofa, her head by the speaker, finding comfort in the sounds of the late-night music and the glorious timbre of his voice. <p> In high school, he had studied the techniques of several top AM DJs, and prided himself on being able to identify the voice of each of the Seven Good Guys when they would do their WABC station promos or when they would fill in on a product endorsement. He knew their distinct styles -- not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morrow or Herb Oscar Andersen, but the little idiosyncrasies of the obscure mid-morning DJs like Stuart Ullman, who hummed along with the closing bars of each record. He found himself, most of the time, listening not so much to the rock music as to the announcer 's intro or cutout, so that radio, for him, was a kind of reverse image of radio for everyone else. <p> His college years were a featureless expanse of long nights broadcasting from the 20-watt basement studio whose signal was too weak to reach even the top floor of the nearby dorms. He would sleep through much of the morning, pass through afternoon classes as if they were a part of his extended dream, a sort of serial drama for the unconscious mind, and then he would come most fully awake when he would step down into his studio to broadcast through the night. There he would send out for sandwiches or pizza, which he would devour during the 45s, and he would study or write papers during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cue. Each morning he would sign off, then ascend the metal fire stairs, push the panic bar on the studio door, and step into the light of dawn. <p> Graduation, he felt, was much like signing off. He emerged from college just as he had emerged, hundreds of times, from the studio, as if rising into a world bright with danger and uncertainty, for Newark radio, smothered by the powerful clear-signal AMs of Manhattan, had developed a peculiar, somewhat unwholesome, ecosystem of its own, like a mushroom forest flourishing in the damp shadows beneath an oak. The only Newark station Adams had ever listened to, when he could find it on the dial, was the all-soul sound of Newark, WNRK. Something of a pirate station, long rumored to be sailing precariously on the lee side of the FCC and just beyond the reach of its numerous creditors, WNRK played exclusively black music. It would be on the air, seemingly going strong, for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanish from the dial, like a ship that has disappeared around a point, to return, perhaps, a month later, more often than not at a different frequency and with a whole new crew of announcers. It was said that the station was run as a front for a millionaire drug dealer, but no one had any idea who he was, or even how to find the studio, which was rumored to be either aboard a ship moored beyond the three-mile coastal limit, or in an outbuilding on the grounds of one of the big estates up in the western hills. <p> Aside from the elusive WNRK, the Newark radio scene consisted of several religious stations, both fundamentalist and gospel, one Hispanic station, and Zlotsky 's easy-listening station, which had the advantage, at least for the job applicant, of being the only one listed in the telephone book. <p> " Zlotsky 's okay. He puts out a lot of rules. Most of them I can deal with. " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adams and the receptionist were drinking iced tea in the Commerce Cafeteria, a brightly lit shop on Market set between the two office towers. The place did a furious rush business at lunch, and through the rest of the day, while office boys and secretaries smoked, cracked gum, and flirted, the surly waitresses in brown pleated uniforms assembled big cardboard trays of coffee and pastry, writing with their soggy pencils on the cracking plastic lids in a strange, nearly indecipherable code meant to identify, in the cool offices high above, the regular from the extra light from the no sugar from the black. <p> The girl 's name was Evelyn, a name that she detested. She had a black cat tatooed on her wrist, and she thought Cat would be a good radio name. Adams agreed. <p> " Course I do n't think RNJ 's the kind of station where I 'd like to make my grand debut, " she said. <p> " Why not? To be piped into malls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice that launched a thousand shops. " <p> Cat smiled at this. " I doubt our signal 's piped in anywhere. I do n't know who all listens to us. " <p> " Someone must, " Adams said. " It 's pretty fancy digs he 's got for a station with a negative Arbitron. " <p> Cat shrugged. She had been around the station for a while, and there were many things about the place that she could n't explain. She liked her job just enough not to try. <p> " I do n't think Zlotsky 's in this for the money, " she said. " He 's already made a bundle, in retail. Used to sell used lamps on Springfield Avenue, then he got into new appliances, electrical fixtures and stuff. " <p> " In the beginning, there was lighting, huh? " <p> " I guess so. " This time Cat laughed. It was fun to talk this way about Zlotsky. " Whatever, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's an ego thing. " <p> " He likes the power of being able to broadcast? To project his tastes out onto the vast, unseen populace? Seems a real waste to have all that power and use it only to preach the virtues of Mantovani. " <p> Cat took a long swallow from her iced tea. She had left the tall spoon in the glass, and the ice rattled against it like tiny bells. <p> " He scares me a little. He 's not around the studio much, and people are always stopping by, looking for him, people that 've got nothing to do with radio. I figure this station 's just a small part of his interests. " <p> Then probably, Adams thought, he 'll let me alone to run my show. <p> " This is a music station, Adams, not a place for jokers and yackers like on AM. " Zlotsky believed that the announcer 's voice was to be heard only for song and title credits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ID : " From the top of the Commerce Building in downtown Newark, and the top of your FM dial, this is radio New Jersey, WRNJ. " <p> Adams could n't figure out why Zlotsky had hired him ; it made about as much sense as asking Eric Clapton to join the Lawrence Welk Orchestra. WRNJ had been for years a steady beacon of boredom, spreading its thick waves of fat, bland music, like schmaltz, over the city for as far back as Adams could recall. Now it amused Adams to think of the loyal RNJ listener, falling asleep or settling into a lover 's arms to the sounds of Liza Minelli or 1001 Strings, shocked alert by Springsteen or Aerosmith. They would think that perhaps a wire had come loose in their receiver, or in their mind. These people he would n't hold ; in fact, Adams suspected that, like a junkyard dog, he might scare them off the premises forever. <p> His rightful listeners would have to find him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he were sending an encrypted message out upon the airs of Newark, a siren song meant to lure his secret sharers. He knew them : insomniac station scanners or compulsive dial spinners who had come upon him in their wanderings. Floating on the late-night radio waves, they would shoal upon his isle of rock. He wished that he could stay with them longer, and he felt a touch of sorrow as he abandoned them, at dawn, to drift through the swells of orchestral music on the sunrise show. <p> After work, Adams would walk around downtown Newark, watching the first commuters, still half shrouded in darkness, descend from the buses at the Public Service terminal. Standing on the Macarthur Highway overpass, he would gaze down on the first cars streaming into the vast asphalt lots beside the railroad tracks, and he would stay until the lots filled. He would watch the office workers emerge from their cars, one by one, like beach turtles hatching from a mass of eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slope from the cindery lot to the clean glass office towers, their natural habitats. They passed before him, the varieties of urban life : the secretaries in crisp summer dresses ; the lawyers and insurance men, heads down toward the gray pavement, mumbling to themselves ; an office boy rushing by, running a wet comb through his thick, shiny hair ; the blind man from the newsstand, moving as if in a world of his own, his white stick tapping the pavement before him like a long, thin bone. <p> When the last of the office workers had disappeared into the great wedge of the large glass revolving doors that footed the two skyscrapers on Commerce Street, the pace of the city slowed. It was as if a tide had receded, and left behind the very old, the very young, and the very poor. Some carried tattered shopping bags or pushed babies in strollers, as they made a slow and deliberate pilgrimage to each of the discount stores around the square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bins of scarves, shoes, and cheap vinyl purses. In Soldiers ' Park, old men on benches read the Star-Ledger and the racing forms and tossed donut crumbs and peanuts to the nacreous pigeons. When the policeman on his chestnut horse was at the farthest point in his lumbering rounds, they tried to sleep in the sunlight and shake off the ravages of hard drinking and a hard life. <p> Adams would pass the morning reading the paper, drinking coffee at the counter at Chock Full o ' Nuts, then wandering slowly through the back streets east of the business district, along the Penn Central tracks. He loved the outdoor fruit stands and the second-hand shops on Mulberry Street, a street so badly neglected that the asphalt surface had been worn away and the cobblestones from the 19th century reemerged, like sleepers waking from a tomb, to serve again as pavement. The passing traffic made a pleasant clopping sound that could be heard occasionally beneath the insistent tinny beat of a Latin Calypso AM station out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nearly every car that rumbled past. <p> Adams would sometimes stop at a stand to buy a mango or papaya, then he would browse in one of the junk stores, checking out the record bins at the back. Eventually he would go back out to Mulberry, where he would stand in the late morning shadows of the Rio, a hotel for transients, laid off dock workers, mostly, who would lean out of their open windows, smoking, arguing in Spanish, and swearing at one another or at their friends passing along the sidewalk below. By late morning Adams would head to the weedy old Morris Canal, long defunct, now just a drainage ditch holding the overflow from the Passaic, glutted with abandoned shopping carts, blackwall tires, and rusted hulks and chassis, and he would follow the cement embankment back up past the railroad station and the deserted parking lots, where the cars baked in the noon sun, to the Commerce Building, in time to meet Cat when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed neighborhood out near the Elizabeth line. From her bedroom window, she could hear the planes, thundering like a great storm, on their approach to Newark Airport. She and Adams would lie on top of the Indian bedspread and listen. Sometimes they could hear a thump as the landing gear folded open, and sometimes, when a plane would make a low approach late in the afternoon, a long shadow would pass over their naked bodies like a visible grace. <p> When it was hot, they would lie in bed through the evening, getting up only for lemonade or a bowl of sherbet. They rarely sat down to dinner, they never went out. Often they would talk through the night, and Adams would find that it was almost midnight and he had to catch the last bus downtown to get to the studio on time. Sometimes it was n't until he got there and cued the first record that Adams realized that he had n't slept since the day before. Strangely, he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning he would stay downtown and watch the city come awake before riding back to Cat 's to fall into a dreamless sleep. <p> Cat had been working at WRNJ for more than a year, and so far she had yet to speak into a microphone or cue a record. In fact, she had yet to see anyone do so. The programs were all on tape, which was recorded elsewhere and delivered to the studio twice a week by UPS. The engineer would unpack the big fiat metal spools, cue them up, twist a few knobs, adjust some dials, then settle back in one of the comfortable swivels and read the paper while the beautiful music played. Cat had little to do all day except keep up appearances, hers and the station 's. She occasionally did some typing, or she selected and arranged the fruit, orchids, and glossy magazines that Zlotsky ordered every week for his office and the waiting room. " Keep the fruit bowl full and stultify, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that Zlotsky thought of her as an attractive but expendable piece of decor. She was too good for the job, Adams said, but it was too good a job to walk away from -- comfortable, easy, predictable, very much like the music that the station played. <p> One morning in the fall, while Cat was immersed in her nails, with the station humming along quietly behind her, the studio door opened and a man stepped in, carrying a small parcel wrapped in brown parchment. He was a small man, with a sinewy strength, and he seemed to exude a kind of furtive intensity that immediately made Cat wary and uneasy, as if she had come upon a snake. <p> " I got this package here, to deliver to Mr. Z., " the man said. " It 's for him, personal. " <p> " Mr. Zlotsky is n't in. Was he expecting you? " <p> " He said to meet him at the studio, " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were scanning the premises, taking it all in as quickly as possible. " Zis his studio? " <p> " Sure, " Cat said. " But I do n't know if he 's coming in today. He 's not in every day. " <p> " What you talkin '? " The man squinted his eyes so that they looked like hard black pits. " I know he be in the studio ev'y day! " <p> Cat shook her head lightly, a kind of diffident shrug of puzzlement. " Not really, " she said. <p> " Maybe this is the wrong place, man. I 'm lookin ' for the Mr. Zlotsky? Big guy, always with the cigar? " <p> " Yes, that 's him. But he 's not here, and I do n't know... " <p> "... he said he wanted to check out my sounds. I got him a sample. " <p> " Was Mr. Zlotsky expecting you, " she asked him. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself just outside the studio, his face halfshrouded in a silver cloud of cigar smoke. When the little chevron above the elevator doors flushed red, as if infused with blood, Zlotsky would step forward to meet his visitor, take him by the elbow, and usher him directly into his private office. <p> " No, uh, he 's not expecting me, but he 'll like these sounds, " the man said to Cat. " He 'll like these sounds of Newark. " <p> He set his parcel, thickly wrapped in several folds of butcher 's paper, before Cat on the desk. She looked at it for a moment, and, when she looked up, he was gone. He had passed silently through the studio door and stood, hunched and sinuous, before the bank of elevators. Cat watched him until, with a ping and a pneumatic hiss, the elevator arrived, the man stepped into its cube of light, then disappeared behind the big door that closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Adams knew what he thought. They should open the packet and play the record, at least for laughs. Cat had brought the parcel home, for she had n't seen Zlotsky all day. She was n't sure she should give it to him, anyway. <p> " I think the guy 's probably a nut, " Cat said. <p> " For a nut, he 's pretty sure about what he 's doing. " <p> " Probably bugs stations all over the city. " <p> " We never saw him at Rutgers, " Adams said. He took a sip of wine. They were enjoying what Cat called home-made rose, a pitcher of mixed white and red. Adams believed that drinking it made him see stripes, like a barber pole 's. <p> " I do n't know then. Beats me. Something steered him wrong, ' cause I do n't think Zlotsky was the one meant to get this. " <p> " Definitely. Wrong guy, wrong station, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last thing in the world Zlotsky would want would be sounds of Newark. " <p> Cat handed Adams the disc. It was wrapped in wrinkled parchment, and tied loosely with string. He examined it, as if it were some kind of talisman. <p> Cat did n't have a spindle for 45s, so Adams had to try to center the disc as best he could around the 33 peg. Even after a few tries, he could n't get it quite right, and he could see the record trace a funny oblong shape as the turntable revolved. <p> The sound, too, seemed uncentered and wobbly, as if it were about to fall off an edge. Some heavy brass, a saxophone wail, a hard percussion beat kicked it off, and then chaos -- as if it were a live club recording done by a hidden mike. The background noises surged forward, like a tide, and washed out the noise from the stage band. There was laughter, breaking glass, two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like " Get over here, now, " as if she were calling to an errant child, then popping noises like gunfire or a car exhaust, and in the distance a voice singing, perhaps with the band or maybe not, maybe it was someone across the room lost in his own world, first doing some simple scat notes in jazz tempo, then just talking, rapidly, about the people and the power and arms to the nation until suddenly, as if a plug were pulled and the room had drained away, the sound stopped dead and the phonograph needle thumped against the paper island at the center of the disc. <p> At first Adams thought that the recording was a mistake, that the man had dubbed in the wrong section from a master tape, but then the sound began to make sense to him, and he thought that maybe this was a work of genius, an avant-garde composition meant to sound deliberately and aggressively amateur so as to express all the anger and confusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that he had moved within, passed through, but never felt, never seen. <p> " You think this guy 's got an album, or tape, we could get a hold of, " he asked Cat. <p> " No, I think this is one of a kind, thank God, " she said. But Adams was sure that there was something to the sound. He held the empty parcel in his hands, turned it over, flattened the wrapping on the coffee table. There was an address, crudely written in black marker, just a street address on Passaic Avenue, and below that a little triangle drawn in pen. Beneath the triangle, Adams felt a bulge in the wrapping, and, when he pulled apart the layers of the parchment, he found between the folds a small, cellophane packet, stapled closed. It held about a spoonful of grainy, white powder. Adams put that in his pocket, and tore the address off the parcel. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Adams stayed up and played the record again, trying to decipher the militant background singing, the pulses of drunken conversation, the cries of the hollering woman, who sounded more plaintive and hopeless each time that he heard her, as if the child she was calling were receding ever farther away from the pull of her voice. But the more he tried to make sense of it, the more the whole recording seemed to him thoroughly obscure. Its message, if it had one, seemed to dart away from his glance, the way a slight scratch on the lens of the eyeball eludes our attempt to look at it directly and can only be seen when our gaze is focused on a distant, unrelated object. <p> Passaic Avenue ran through North Newark, past the dark factories and the old, long-abandoned railroad freight yards, home now for rats and derelicts, and down into the marshy plains by the highway where the city 's most gruesome housing projects seemed to rise like obelisks marking the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave way to the chemical fumes, the spoors of industrial waste, and the pools of viscous ooze that seeped through the Jersey meadows. Adams had never before walked here, and now, even early in the morning, when the street was deserted, he felt threatened, as if the deteriorating sidewalk beneath him could at any moment give way and drop him, like a stone, into a sewer line or a sluiceway. <p> Most of the storefronts were boarded up. A few were merely gated closed, and through the dark iron mesh Adams could see jumbled on dusty, crowded shelves the cheapest of merchandise for sale second-hand furniture in one store, flashy shirts made of some horrible synthetic in another, guns and knives, used appliances, twist-off bottles of wine. Who would buy these things? Ahead, casting long shadows over the sprawling neighborhood, were the pale brick twin towers of the projects. <p> The address Adams had been given, pencilled, barely legible, on a scrap of parchment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholesaler tucked away in the lee of the projects. There was a good deal of activity around the meat company this morning. A truck in front was unloading fish and block ice, a big man in a white butcher 's apron argued with a scrawny fellow in a denim jacket. On the sidewalk in front of the store a lone man, somber and intense, wearing a new tan sports jacket too short in the sleeves and too tight in the chest, which made it look as though through sheer intensity of will he were growing right out of his clothes, stood in silence, holding forward in his right hand copies of Elijah Speaks! <p> Through the smudged window of the meat market, Adams could see several men crating cartons from huge storage bins along the walls into the deepfreeze locker. He thought he must have the wrong place, that he had been misled or misdirected. Yet having come so far, and having nowhere else to go, he stepped past the stacked freight into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The rumble of the refrigeration system shaking the whole building made it seem as if he were standing within the works of a large engine. Clouds floated from the walk-in freezer, and sawdust, lit to brilliance like crystals or flakes of gold by the sunlight streaming through the high windows, puffed from the floor as the men shoved about the wooden crates or dropped them onto handcarts and forklifts. Adams had no business here, and knew it, and was about to turn to leave when the light from the doorway was obliterated. The big man in the white apron was standing there, filling the door frame, blocking the light. " Hey, whadda you want? You! " <p> Adams did n't know. He thought he ought to tell the truth. <p> " I guess I 'm at the wrong place. Somebody said to come here about some music, for my radio... " <p> " Music! We ai n't got music here, we got meat, see? Meat! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " Adams stepped toward the door. " I do n't want meat. " <p> " Get him out! " At that a little man, who had been over in a front corner, obscured and beyond the slant of the light, came toward Adams. He had, Adams could see, been unpacking a crate of pork, and he held in one hand a rack of ribs. He set the meat on the countertop, stepped around, and grabbed Adams, with surprising strength, by one shoulder. <p> " It 's okay, there, brother, you come with me. " <p> " Hey, now wait, I 'm leaving, okay? " Adams could feel his voice buckle. <p> " You leaving with me, " the small man said. <p> He guided Adams toward the back of the room, and Adams thought, for a horrifying moment, that they were headed toward the freezer. He could see through the glass window as he walked past the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. He detected a faint smell of ammonia, most likely from the cooling pipes that hummed somewhere overhead. And the next thing he knew, the little man had led him through a back door out into a sunsplashed alleyway. Flies buzzed furiously around two teetering trash bins. Adams squinted, for the sun off the whitewashed cement wall hurt his eyes. <p> " Come on, man, I 'll show you where to take that music. You ai n't the first, " the small man said. <p> Adams thought he should run for the daylight that he could see at the far end of the alley, just break loose and go as fast as he could. Would anyone really bother to give chase? But as if he could anticipate that impulse, the small man warned Adams : " Do n't go for it, man. Ima show you the way. I 'm serious. " <p> There was nothing now but to go along, and, as they walked through the alley behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribbons of blood, Adams followed the man, like a pilgrim following a guide. <p> The alley deposited them into a concrete courtyard, littered with smashed glass, wind-strewn paper, and bone-white shards of fast-food Styrofoam. This open space was meant to be a play area for the children of the projects, but it seemed a wasteland. They crossed the courtyard, and stood before a flat steel door, barred but unlocked. The small man lifted the bar and they stepped into the basement of the project. <p> Inside, Adams was startled by the rank, sharp scent of detergent. The floor was slimy with streaks of soapy wash water. Probably a washing machine down here had leaked, or overturned. In the dim light that filtered through the blackened windows overhead, Adams could barely make out ganglia of heavily taped wires, pipes dripping with sweat and rust, and big tub-like furnaces matted with fibrous sheets of asbestos. As they passed, Adams heard scraping and shuddering sounds, perhaps rats or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man pulled a chain that lit a bare bulb, and Adams saw that they had come to a freight elevator. They stepped onto the platform, and the small man latched closed the door. As the elevator ticked slowly upward through the building, Adams watched the diminishing basement shadows, which seemed, as the bulb revolved in a narrowing spiral from its dangle of cord, to pulsate in the gently oscillating light. <p> Adams watched the girders and planks, the skeletal interior structure of the building, gliding past, then falling out of sight below the elevator floor, like the image on a TV set with a faulty vertical hold, until, with a jolt and the wrenching sound of a cable pulled taut, the elevator stopped. They stepped out onto the pebbled roof of the tower. <p> Adams was surprised by the intensity of the morning heat. Up here, he could look, past the rusting air ducts and beyond the knee-high brick lip at the edge of the roof, too low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge and, top-heavy, tumble down to his death, and see the same urban panorama that he had seen from the RNJ studios. But here, the view seemed, at least to Adams, slightly off kilter, out of alignment. Perhaps because the project towers were isolated in the north end of the city, downtown Newark seemed somehow far off and remote. Adams gazed at the distant parks, the wide streets, the factories with their plumes of smoke, the railroad tracks cutting across the meadows like a surgical scar, and he felt an inexplicable attraction, as if he were seeing for the first time whole a landscape that he had come to love in parts. <p> " It 's a radio station, " the small man said. <p> " I work there, " Adams answered. He had been staring at the Commerce Tower. He had become used to seeing the city from the studio there, so the office tower itself had never been part of his view, and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of us knows so little about the intricate network of broken vessels and the small spots and streaks of color and blood in our own eyes. <p> " It 's not that I 'm talking about, " the man said. " There. This station. " <p> He was looking at a small superstructure, a sort of corrugated construction trailer, propped on a bed of plywood and cinderblock in the center of the roof. Adams noticed for the first time, rising from one corner of the trailer, a spindly antenna bearing the initials, punched out of rusted sheet metal, WNRK. <p> " Go ahead, the man be waitin ' for you, inside. " As Adams stepped toward the small studio, thinking perhaps to introduce himself and to share with the working announcer a moment of professional camaraderie, he understood who was meant to get the parcel. Standing in the doorway, puffing leisurely on a cigar and gazing abstractedly at the excellent prospect across the meadows and toward Manhattan, was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone. Alone on the roof, Adams felt like a weed on a scorched plain, a bramble that had been spared the incendiary wrath of Zlotsky 's stare. He knew that if Zlotsky were to turn and see him on the roof, at the portal of this private domain, he, too, would be ignited by Zlotsky 's vengeance, and his career in radio would be reduced to cinders and smoke. <p> Adams ducked around behind the studio, and saw a bulkhead door left ajar. Perhaps his guide had gone through there. Adams followed, pulling shut the door behind him. He was at the top landing of a long metal staircase that zigzagged down through the building, like a spine. He could smell piss and old cigarettes, the dank and rotten stink of cats and trash. When he peered over the railing, the skeletal iron stairway looked as if it were dropping away into infinity, like the diminishing images reflected in a pair of opposite mirrors. Adams began to scuttle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved, and the echo of his footsteps rang and reverberated, intensifying like a piano played with the foot pedal held to the floor. The sound rose up toward the open bulkhead at the rooftop, like heat, and beneath it Adams descended, lower, lower, lower, like a piece of paper floating to earth, back and forth along the zigzag, until at last he lit on the concrete landing at the bottom, pushed open the huge steel door marked Emergency Exit Only, and stepped out into the daylight. <p> " You always knew. " <p> " I did n't. I always wondered, though. " <p> Adams had never realized before how difficult it was to talk in Cat 's apartment. Every minute, it seemed, a jet from the airport roared past like a storm, so close it seemed to suck the words from the air, even as they left his lips. <p> " You wondered what, " Adams asked her. " What kind of business Zlotsky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always figured there was something shady about the station. I wondered why he cared what music you played. " <p> " And why do you think he cared? " <p> " What? " The building seemed to shake in the wake of a passing jet. Adams repeated his question. <p> " I think, because, to keep us out of competition with his other station. " <p> " Yeah, but his other station does n't really have to make money. Not if he was using it as a front. " <p> " Or, I do n't know. " Cat twirled her hair, twisted it around her fingers, absently. " I think maybe our station 's the front. He can hide all sorts of profits behind it. " <p> " I ca n't figure, though, why that guy left the sample with you. Unless he was scared or just wanted to make trouble. " <p> " Yeah, " Cat said. " Trouble in paradise. " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe, yes, to have a show of his own, through the night, alone in the studio with his music, and with nothing to do in the mornings but walk the streets of the city, and with Cat to come home to, he had found a version of paradise. <p> But now his eyes had been opened, and he felt ashamed that he had agreed to accept Zlotsky 's word as law. His job, his music, his love for Cat -- everything seemed suddenly stained by that acquiescence, as if he had become, somehow, just a hired voice, an instrument of another 's will. He could stay here, he could grow, he could prosper, he could become the greatest radio man in Newark, it would be so easy, but unless he defied Zlotsky, he and Cat, unless they said to Zlotsky no, only so far but no more, he would some day find that he was not just in Zlotsky 's thrall but in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed on with " Midnight Hour, " and then segued into " The Night-time( Is the Right Time) " and a long medley of Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett, Gladys Knight, Smokey Robinson, and then older stuff, early rock like Sonny Till and Orioles and Newark 's own The Monotones, and back into the roots of the blues, Robert Johnson and Elmore James. Adams and Cat each took a mike, and between sets, long sets that had a logic and integrity of their own, like an intelligently conceived LP, they talked to each other, picked up on each other 's phrases, jokes, allusions. It was a broadcast so perfect, so well-timed and so well-paced, that they felt, as anyone listening to them might have, as if they had become part of the music itself, as if they had been dubbed into the tracks. By dawn, Adams had long since forgotten sponsors, station breaks, spot announcements, time checks, news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unbroken, like a great tide washing over the sleeping city, replenishing the weary, making quick the dead, filling with its bounty the thousand and one unmarked channels of silence. <p> They could have gone, had it been possible, straight through past the dawn, but at some dark hour in the early morning, while the city slept and the stars were beginning to thin from the sky, Zlotsky stepped into the studio. He stood in the doorway, gross and dark and seething with pent anger, like a bear enchained, as he tried to contain his fury, to hold control of his thoughts and of his voice. <p> " No, no, " Zlotsky said, and he raised his hand dismissively, in a practiced gesture of ironic contempt. " Do n't take that record off, now. You 've played this, this music, all night, so why stop now? " <p> Adams took off his headset, and turned from the mike. " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. We 're through. " <p> Cat, too, took off her headset. " Mr. Zlotsky, we know about your, your other interests. Adams saw... " <p> " Of course. I saw him there. What, you think I 'm blind? I saw him on the roof, I 've seen you two all this time, I know what goes on here, believe me. " <p> He 'd seen me, Adams thought? Had he known I was coming? Had he somehow intended the parcel for me, to draw me there? Had he, in some way, been testing me? <p> " You understand nothing of what I 've said to you, " Zlotsky went on. His face was obscured behind thick gray streaks of smoke. " You think I care about music, black, white, soul, shmoal. No. It 's a business I run here. I 've got business interests to protect. " <p> " We 're not threatening your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been playing had finished, and the needle pulsed gently in the silent, abortive groove of the final spiral. Their words were now being picked up by the studio mikes. " We 're just trying to breathe some life into it. " <p> " Hoh! What you know about life I could fit into this -- " Zlotsky looked around, as if trying to find some object in the studio puny enough to illustrate his point " -- this finger. " He held up his hand, and the gem in the ring on his pinky sparkled in the greenish glow from the control board. He turned his hand, casting against the studio walls the shafts of light reflected off the facets of the gem, so that Adams felt for a moment as if he were at the focal point of a dark cosmos, watching galaxies wheel about, revolving through space. <p> " Sure, " Adams said, " but the same goes for what you know about music. " <p> " So maybe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, you like this music so much? I have those boys work danmed hard over there. No air conditioning, no fans, no windows. They sweat. Is that what you want? " <p> " I just wanted a job in radio. But now I see the way you run things, and I ca n't be a part of that. " <p> " Listen to Mr. Morality. I hire you green out of college, I pay you well, I treat you well. So I give you just one rule -- and you break it. By which you 're trying to prove what? " <p> " Maybe that I know good from bad, " Adams said. <p> " You do n't know what good is. You proved that. You had it good here. Everything your whole life has been too easy for you, so far. Even the girl. " <p> Adams stood, and Cat feared that he was going to swing at Zlotsky. " Do n't, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot! " She tried to stop Adams, groping toward him through the smoke, but he eluded her touch. It was as if his image were fixed in her sight while his body had dissolved into molecules, dematerialized, so that she was looking at Adams but reaching through his shadow, his ghost. <p> And then she realized, no, Adams was not going for Zlotsky after all. Adams stepped over to the wall and pulled the main power switch. The lights on the board dimmed, then dropped to black. The gentle hum of the studio machinery, almost inaudible during the broadcast, jumped to a high pitch, then a whine, then spun off the orbit of sound and into silence. The turntable continued to revolve, but ever more slowly, as the weight of the needle dragged it gently toward a state of rest. The station was off the air. <p> " Now what I ask you to do, " Zlotsky said, " is to leave here. Leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studio in darkness, the city, touched by the light of dawn, came into view, at first as if through a haze or a distorting lens but gradually, as their eyes adjusted to the conditions of light, more focused and clear, the way a developing photographic image seems to emerge from a solution and settle gently on the contact paper. The city looked much the same as on that day when Adams first had seen it from this vantage : remote, silent, abundant with a hidden life. To the south, he could see the boxy buildings of the airport, darkened beside their spectral towers and deserted runways lined with red and violet beacons. To the west were the suburban hills, where through the limbs of the distant trees, now brown and bare, he could discern the faint, ghostly shapes of the magnificent houses, schools, and country clubs that followed the old highways out toward the summit of Orange Mountain. To the north, beyond the meadows and the overpass, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The drawbridge over the Passaic was still up. Even at this hour, barges steamed out past Port Newark and on to the sea. Over the railroad tracks and to the east, like a silhouette traced in pencil on the colorless morning sky, was the skyline of Manhattan, a boundary so vivid, and so seemingly intransmutable, that it almost defined, for all within its purview, the concept of horizon. Adams thought, once he had surveyed the view from the studio, that he never again would have such a clear sense of his surroundings, and of the limits of sight. And then, in the gathering light, he and Cat collected their belongings and in silence, but together, took their way. <p> <p> <p> By Elliot Krieger <p>
