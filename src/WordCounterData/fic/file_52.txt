1008241 At the Rehab <p> The M &M's; scattered in your crusted bed sheets <p> make me sick, likewise the clotted applesauce <p> stuck to the table. Did you fall asleep <p> eating? Patients are supposed to be quiet, <p> stay in cranked-up beds, clean in the clean pajamas. <p> They do n't scatter candy in their bed sheets ; <p> they do n't whirl their wheelchairs in fury, scream <p> for whatever, then wait for applause, <p> bow to a hospital table. Did you sleep <p> at all last night -- or is this the disease? <p> I 'm silly to read disaster into this mess, <p> you were never neat -- but crusted bed sheets? <p> I look at your bony face, your empty eyes, <p> how your peeling fingers tremble as you brush <p> ice water off the table. You fall asleep <p> suddenly then startle, wake up weeping. <p> What will happen after you 've crushed <p> all the M &M's; into the bed sheets <p> now coveting the table? When will you sleep? <p>
