1013041 We first met Maggot, the young man raised as a troll, in " A Democracy of Trolls " back in our Oct/Nov. 2002 issue. Maggot went on to appear in the novel The Prodigal Troll, which chronicles his origin and some of his adventures in the world of men. This new adventure finds him on his own again- <p> THAT WINTER MAGGOT forged a new trail east out of the mountains, down into a wilderness occupied by neither men nor trolls. Great-tusked woolly mammoths wandered among herds of buffalo and flat-horned elk. They were stalked by packs of broad-necked, trap-jawed dyrewolves and solitary dagger-toothed lions. Maggot hunted with spear and arrow, taking deer when he could, caching for later use what he could not eat. In the coldest month, when every stream and pond was frozen, and even the air smelled like brittle ice, a panther began to shadow Maggot, stealing from his caches. Gathering up dry bones and vines, Maggot baited a snare near a fresh kill. He waited two nights and part of a third day, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. As it stepped into the noose, Maggot yanked it tight. The panther jumped as the vine closed on its leg, and then took off running from the clatter of bones tied to the other end. Maggot stood, stiff from waiting, his laughter rolling through the snow-laden boughs of the trees. " Did you see that? " he asked aloud, turning, eyes aglitter. " Did you see that? " But there was no one there to see it. As soon as the echo of his voice disappeared in the cold air, he could not even say for sure which language he 'd spoken in, that of troll or man. His grin faded. He stood there a moment, staring at the remains of his careful prank-the scar in the snow where the hidden vine snapped up, the tracks of the fleeing panther. Orphaned as an infant, Maggot had been raised by a troll mother as her own. By the time he became a young man, he was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet tall, with thick black hair and pale skin. He 'd descended to the lower valleys where humans lived, in search of friends and a mate. What he 'd found was war and a woman who would n't break the customs of her people to have him. He turned away from the tripped snare, and left behind the silence of the trees and the trail of the panther. As he ran through the snow, cold to the bone, he said to himself, in a language of men, " Stupid people. I 'm through with them. " Then added, in the tongue of trolls, " Stupid trolls. I 'm through with them too. " Swift rivers rolled down the eastern slopes of the mountains, forming serpentine paths through rugged highlands. Maggot followed one after another until he came to crashing falls : one plummeted so fast, through such a narrow gorge, it created rushing wind ; another several days farther south poured over seven wide drops, ten feet tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buildings of the city of his friend, Bran ; a third fell two hundred feet, sending up a mist that captured arcs of color from the sun. Beyond the falls he always encountered signs of men, marks carved in trees and distant wisps of smoke rising into the sky. Each time he saw those signs, he turned back, until it was spring, when gray skies, gale winds, and cold, steady rains made it impossible for many days in a row to find any game, much less kill it. He took shelter under a dark wing of rock stretched over a ravine filled with churning water. When deer came, they surprised him by coming from the wrong direction headed downstream - and bounded away before he could string his bow. Bow in one hand and several arrows in the other, he leapt after them. He splashed knee-deep through swirling icy water, careful not to lose his footing, and gave chase up the far bank. One lagged a little behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Maggot to see its flank flash crimson in the light. He chose that one for his target, without pausing to wonder how it had been wounded. Knowing the curve and cut of the land, he angled through the trees, over a small hill, and came to the edge of a meadow, nocking an arrow as he went down on one knee. He expected to see the deer crossing the grass, a clear target. But there were no deer - across the meadow a group of bearded men in buckskin and bright cloth were also hunting. Though they did not wear the braids of knights of the empire, at least one carried a sword on the belt at his waist. They saw Maggot in the same moment he saw them. Arrows leapt from their bows at him. Releasing his own arrow at the nearest man, Maggot tumbled out of the way and rolled to his feet. The same undergrowth that denied him a clear shot at the deer failed to hide his escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but wherever he went, his pursuers found him. The rain left too many easy marks, in the mud and leaves, for seasoned trackers to follow. The four men separated into pairs, attempting to herd him this way or that like he was some panicked doe driven by a pack of wolves. They were fools, although he knew that if he paused to mock them they would catch him. He noticed a pain on the back of his left thigh as he ran - an arrow had torn away a chunk of flesh and his lower leg was slick with blood. It must have happened during the first volley they shot at him, although he had n't felt it at the time. Just like the wounded deer he 'd been trying to shoot. Having traded position with the deer, Maggot led the hunters on a chase through the dusk, across one morass and another, until he came to a steep bluff beside a stream. He pulled himself hand over hand up one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuers took a few wild shots at him when he peered from his new perch. As the sky turned from purple to blue-black, they paused for a brief conference with one another, then relinquished their pursuit and turned back. Finally. Maggot was tired and irritated. He needed food, and arrows to replace those he had lost. The men who had chased him were the likeliest source of both. So he too reversed his direction, and clambered back down the ridge. He cautiously took up their trail and followed them toward their camp. He favored his injured left leg, and fell behind before he knew their destination. But Maggot, who had decided to leave stupid men behind, was now determined to find them again. 2. IN THE nocturnal uplands in springtime, strange paths lead to dead-ends in drowned ground or deep thickets of impassable undergrowth. Not even Maggot, who had lived his childhood in darkness with the trolls, could find a clear trail through the marshy hollows along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, he went cautiously, and also in case the men he pursued lay in wait for him as he would have done for them. The gash on his leg throbbed. Everything he liked about this land scant months before - abundance of game and the absence of men - no longer held true. A dagger-toothed lion 's roar dropped off the steep mountainsides some miles away, perhaps in similar complaint. He smelled the camp first - the scent of roasted venison and the sharp stink of wood smoke. Their fire filled a little bowl of land with long flickering shadows, and drew him as certainly as a moth. He would sneak into their camp, filch what he needed or wanted, then continue his trek into the empty mountains west. Creeping forward, he hid among the trees. Brush had been cleared from the center of the small dell and piled up in a rough wall around the camp. The orange glow of the fire reflected on white bones piled in a midden outside the brush wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, he gathered that some small scavengers fed there. He skirted the camp in the opposite direction to avoid any unwelcome chance encounters or alarms. A badger could ruin everything. Up close, he counted eleven men, mostly seated around the fire, talking loud and vigorously as if they feared nothing in the darkness. Unmoving shapes on the ground could have been sleeping men or packs of some sort. Maggot sat down patiently, waiting for them to fall asleep. As soon as he stopped moving, his injured leg began to stiffen. The group of men rose and went over to one of the shapes lying immobile on the ground, where they began yelling at it and gesturing into the forest. Maggot did n't recognize any of the words. They were wholly unlike any of the three languages - Trollish, Wyndan, or Imperial - that he knew. But the meanings were clear enough, especially once they started kicking the figure. They wanted information, and the man on the ground was unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as it either created an opportunity for him to take what he wished or delayed his assault on the camp - until they took splinters of burning wood from the fire. The first coal-red ends of the sticks extinguished themselves in the dark shape of the man 's body, and his screams shot like bolts through the dark. Leaping to his feet, Maggot darted past the edge of the trees before he caught himself. A hatred of fire, used as a weapon, had been deeply ingrained in him by his mother. He cupped his hands and drummed out the troll 's " danger, death " warning on his chest. The torture stopped as all eyes, dark in their sockets, turned his way. He did not know if the men recognized the sound, or its meaning, but the torture stopped. While a small group of men gathered weapons and ventured in his direction, Maggot darted to the other side of the camp and repeated the sound. Those who dared the darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firelight and, after a brief exchange among themselves, went after him again. But he had moved to a new position. As soon as the others reached their simple wall of brush, he pounded out the warning tattoo for the third time, adding his voice to it - a bellowing, guttural cry of challenge and defiance. Several arrows whizzed immediately in his direction, but he had already dropped and as soon as they whistled past him, he scuttled off again. In the brief interval of silence that followed, the dagger-toothed lion roared, this time much closer than before. Maggot found himself between two dangers - the men who 'd tried to kill him once already today and a lion who, if she was as hungry as he was, would attempt the same. He pulled himself up into the crotch of a giant elm tree. Although immobile, he had a better perch to observe the men and watch for the lion. He soon realized that his impulsive actions had ruined his chances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Between his din and the lion, the men showed no inclination to rest. They paced around the perimeter of their camp, added more fuel to the fire, and seemed to argue over sending scouts into the darkness. Neither Maggot nor the lion made another sound, and after a time, a few men lay down, then more. But their eyes, those that he could see, stayed wide open. Other men took turns as sentries, sitting by the light and piling wood on the blaze., The men did n't return to tormenting their victim, however. Maggot was satisfied with that. The air grew colder, the silver clouds fell apart in shreds, and the stars beyond them wheeled across the sky. Stuck in his tree, Maggot faced a difficult choice. He wanted food and weapons from the camp, he wanted to be far from this vicinity by the time morning arrived, and he wanted to know where the lion was before he started on his way. He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and continue on his way, when the buzz of a snorer told him that the men had started to doze off. He decided to wait. A short while later, the sentry by the fire yawned. He added more logs to the fire, then lifted his hands above his head and stretched his arms. In a split second, Maggot fitted an arrow to his bow, drew, aimed, and released. The bolt shot in under the guard 's left arm and pierced his heart, killing him instantly. Maggot jumped from the crotch of the tree, alighting just as the guard collapsed in a heap on the ground. In seconds he was inside the camp, though the scab that had formed over the wound on the back of his thigh broke open and started to bleed again. Moving silently, he grabbed a quiver of arrows from the side of one sleeping figure and cut a strip of badly charred venison from the spit beside the fire. He was shoving the blackened meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not asleep. The prisoner. He was fair-skinned, like the others, but with lighter hair, maybe blond, maybe gray-white, long and unbraided. He wore nothing, having been stripped of all his clothes and possessions. His ankles were bound together and his arms outspread, staked to the ground. There were burn marks on his thighs, his stomach, and his face. Although his mouth was not gagged, he neither shouted out a warning nor made any attempt to ask for assistance. Maggot stooped, used his knife to quickly saw through the bonds. He did it less to help the man, who meant nothing to him, than to frustrate the hunters who had frightened his game and chased him all that day. The prisoner did n't care about his motivations. He met Maggot 's eyes and smiled, a wry small curling of the lips. He briskly rubbed his feet to restore circulation and then plundered the dead sentry 's weapons. Almost a minute had passed and Maggot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last large piece of meat off the spit when there were abrupt sounds of the lion 's roar, a scuffle at the bone pile, snarls and a single high-pitched squeal. One or two of the men jumped up, startled, and on seeing Maggot and the prisoner, shouted, bringing all the others to their feet. Maggot shoved the meat in his teeth, troll fashion, and ran for the forest. One man stood in his way. Maggot dodged to one side, but the man leapt at him, and they grappled briefly until Maggot slashed his arm and he fell back with a shout. Another of the hunters rushed at him and dropped as the prisoner cut him down with the sentry 's sword. The fair-haired man said something, jerking his head as if to give Maggot the lead. But Maggot was already off running, wincing as he leapt the brush pile, fleeing into the darkness beyond the fire and the camp. The other man could follow if he wanted. If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young leaves around them, the former prisoner sprinted forward to catch up. Maggot stretched his legs and ran faster. 3. NO IMMEDIATE pursuit appeared to follow the last volley, but Maggot was unwilling to rest. Now more than ever, he wanted to cover that distance toward the mountains where he felt sure he could elude any number of pursuers. But he ran on at an uncomfortably slow pace, compared to his normal speed, because of the ache in his leg. Blood flowed from the scab, streaking his calf and making his foot slick. He concentrated on ignoring the sharp pain. A look over his shoulder revealed the prisoner at his heels. He carried the scabbard and sword in one hand, and a small bag in the other, pumping his arms to keep up. Once they reached the ridgetops, passing from one to the next, they slowed again to avoid tumbling into the marshy bottom lands between the hills. They paused on one tree-covered slope to consider the alternatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to choose any certain trail. Maggot studied the sky through the immature canopy. The moon had set earlier, but from the position of the stars and the smell of the wind, he judged that they were heading in a southerly direction and so he sought out the more westerly path. But the prisoner had studied the sky also, and had his own sense of direction. He said something to Maggot, and pointed out a track that would take them farther south. When Maggot turned to answer, the other man pointed at Maggot 's mouth. His lips curled into that small smile again before cracking into open laughter. Maggot 's hand leapt to his lips - he 'd forgotten the meat clenched tight between his jaws. He took it in his hand and laughed also, a deep, resonant laugh that made his shoulders shake before he stifled it in case there were pursuers. Remembering his manners, he offered it to the other man out of reflex. " It 's ruined with burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, because this man reminded him more of his friend Bran. " But it fills the belly. " The man 's eyes narrowed, but he grinned as he accepted it. He tore it in half and gave the larger half back, much to Maggot 's relief as he quickly shoved the meat into his own mouth. They both chewed for a moment in silence. Maggot thought about how he had n't laughed in months, except for the joke he played on the hunting cat. He thought about trying to explain that incident. Before he could speak, the stranger said something Maggot did n't understand - not a word sounded familiar - and once again pointed to the more southerly of the two trails. Maggot had intended to go on alone into the far reaches of the mountains. But it was better that they keep moving, and either direction would take them farther from the group of hunters. Maggot gestured for him to lead on. While he did not run, as Maggot had, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the wooded slope to a stream where they paused to sip. Water was plentiful, so there was no need to drink until their bellies swelled and slowed them down. Maggot 's estimation of his companion rose in measure to his moderation. The other man looked at Maggot, then touched one finger to his chest. " Ehren, " he repeated several times. The words rolled off his tongue with a strangely liquid sound to them. Maggot understood at once. He sorted through all the names he 'd been given among people, and answered instead with the name his troll mother had always called him, the oldest name he knew for himself. " Maggot, " he said, tapping his own chest. The other man nodded, and spouted a rapid flow of words as if perfect communication had been established. Finally, out of reflex and frustration, Maggot made a bitter face, sticking out his tongue. It was the way he 'd learned to say no and stop. Ehren 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking his head. Maggot responded in kind. It was very good to laugh again. Standing up, Ehren led them south. When the sun rose on their left, they had traveled nearly two leagues across difficult wilderness. Maggot felt satisfied that they were safe from the hunters and would have carried on at a more leisurely pace later in the day after resting. But Ehren was avid to push on. His burns looked raw in the dawn. " Where are we rushing to? " Maggot asked in the language of the empire, not expecting any answer, at least none he could comprehend. His leg ached and he wanted rest. " Let 's find a nice cool place to sleep. " Ehren glanced at Maggot, but would not pause, and he did not even glance back when Maggot repeated the question in the language of the mountain people. Maggot was growing irritated, but he decided to go on. He liked Ehren, because they had laughed together. Several times they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them quickly. Near midday, they spotted a herd of the wood bison grazing in the forest. Maggot preferred their meat to venison when he could get it. The tongues were especially tasty. Indicating Maggot 's bow, Ehren directed Maggot to shoot one or offered to do it instead. Maggot tapped his own chest, indicating his preference. Ehren nodded acceptance and began creeping toward the game. Maggot grabbed his shoulder and stopped him. He wrinkled his nose, making a slight sniffing sound, then made a follow-me motion and led Ehren downwind. He shifted his weight as he walked, to ease the injured leg. Bison had terrible eyesight, but their sense of smell was as strong as a troll 's. The slightest whiff of something unusual could send them into a panic. Even a breeze too light to stir the leaves could carry a human scent. Maggot counted seven animals in all - a bull, three cows, and three calves. They grazed in a meadow about a hundred feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nearer calf, and sunk a feathered shaft into its side. The animal bleated in terror, as the other bison lowed and bolted. Not knowing which direction danger came from, they stampeded in Maggot 's direction, leaving the wailing calf behind spiraling in a wounded circle as it fell. The cows and surviving calves veered off into the forest. But the bull, whether by chance or some vagary of the wind, focused his red eyes right on Maggot 's position. He lowered his heavy horned head, squared the great hump of his shoulders, and charged. Maggot meant to dash to the nearest tree, but his injured leg tightened at the sharp movement and the bull was on him. Dropping his bow, Maggot braced himself and grabbed the short, sharp horns in either hand. The impact tossed him backward, but he jumped with it, landing again on his feet, still clinging to the horns. The bull bellowed, shrugging its massive shoulders, lifting Maggot again. This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, attempting to drive the beast into the ground. It reacted in confusion and panic, trying to pull away, but Maggot screamed and wrenched the neck with all the strength he 'd earned by wrestling trolls much larger than himself. As the bull 's front legs buckled beneath it, Maggot prepared to let go and run for the trees. But Ehren rushed forward and thrust his sword through its throat. The great animal grunted, tried to heave itself up, and collapsed. Maggot stood there panting heavily. He would not have killed it, knowing the cows and calves were now unprotected. When he looked up at Ehren, the other man was grinning, running his fingertip along the wet broad side of the sword, and licking the blood from it. He saw Maggot watching and wiggled his eyebrows humorously. Across the meadow, the stricken calf gave out a few depleted bleats. Limping more than he cared to think about, Maggot went over to the poor creature. Its tongue lolled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without budging its body. Drawing his knife, Maggot dispatched the calf quickly. They gutted the smaller animal, and Maggot would have been happy enough to eat it raw. When Ehren balked at this, Maggot drew forth his flint and steel. They could dare a small fire, and Ehren gathered branches of a type that produced very little smoke, which thinned and dissipated before it passed the treetops. The flesh was still pink, and running with juices when they ate, which was well enough for Maggot. He examined his injured leg more closely when they were done. The tear in the muscle was the size of a nut. The pain did not bother him as much as the other consequences. It needed time to heal, but instead he kept straining it. Based on the tone of his voice, Ehren was asking Maggot questions. Maggot walked away. A small stream trickled through the lower end of the meadow. He drank from it, then cleaned the wound and bound it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breechcloth. Ehren joined him. " We should find a hidden place and sleep while the day lasts, " Maggot said in the language of the empire, and then the mountain people. He was exhausted. " We 'll continue tonight, after dark. " Ehren shook his head and spoke vigorously, peaking his hands, and making dropping motions. Maggot gathered after a while that he was describing the land he came from, somewhere in the south in the shelter of the mountain ranges. He soon understood the words for mountain, and Ehren 's description of a waterfall. " A mountain and a waterfall, " Maggot said, using Ehren 's words. He laughed, but this time it was not such a happy sound. " This land is nothing but mountain and waterfall. " Ehren began explaining all over again, pointing to the east. " Enough, " Maggot said, cutting him off with a sharp turn of his shoulder. " I 'm tired, and I hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us wrap what meat we can carry in the skins we cut, and find some hole or hidden place where we can sleep before other scavengers arrive. " He pointed to the buzzards circling in the sky above the meadow. Ehren comprehended well enough that he gathered their store of food. When he saw Maggot limping, he offered an arm to help him along. Maggot refused. He had no intentions of going any farther than a decent resting place. When they came to a tumbled outcrop of rock that offered some minimal shelter, Maggot lay down, shoving his bundle under a ledge of stone, then scooting in beside it. Ehren had dark circles under his eyes as well, made worse by the burn marks on his cheeks. He became angry, indicating that they should go on while there was still daylight. " You can go wherever you like, " Maggot said. " But I 'm going to sleep. " And that was exactly what he did, burrowing his head into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he felt a footstep nearby. Instantly he rolled to his feet, alert, defensive, knife drawn and ready to strike. But it was only Ehren, who took a step back. It was several hours later. He held his bag in one hand, and it appeared heavier. There was mud on his fingers, and the sword in his fist. " You should not startle me, " Maggot said, and Ehren nodded at the sound of his voice, then quickly indicated that he was lying down to sleep. " Very smart, " Maggot said, and when the other man was still, he settled down again himself. He slept dreamlessly, awakening as easily as he 'd fallen asleep. When he saw Ehren on the ground near him, he was glad. He 'd started to like the man. He thought about his two friends - Sinnglas, one of the mountain people he had rescued from a flood, and Bran, a knight he 'd rescued from Sinnglas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, he thought. He would rescue people, and they would become his friends. Dawn brightened the eastern sky, promising another clear day. For trolls, dawn signaled death, an end to the safety of darkness. Maggot knew that people saw it differently, looked on dawn as a beginning. He looked at it hopefully. And saw smoke on the horizon. It had to be the hunters, and no more than a mile or so away. Perhaps as close as the meadow where he and Ehren had slain the bison. He shook his companion awake. Ehren jerked upright, and Maggot pointed out the cord of smoke. " They 've followed us, " he said. " And they do not even care to hide themselves. " Ehren nodded, as if he had expected exactly this. In seconds they gathered their simple belongings and resumed their journey. Maggot willed his leg to work as it always did, ignoring the pain and refusing to favor it. While the birds were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the hills until they came to a river. Ehren led them upstream, seeking a good spot to cross. Maggot mistrusted the river-branches rushed by, the water seeming to flow both deep and fast. Finally they reached a place where the river widened out. Large rocks protruding above the surface promised a path across. Ehren removed his belt and, holding his sword above his head, started wading instantly toward the other shore. The water lapped at his calves, and came up as high as his waist before growing shallow again. Maggot followed after him, step by step, but Ehren quickly reached the other bank, and stood there, gesturing Maggot this way and then the other, trying to keep him to the path. The icy river swirled around Maggot 's legs, numbingly cold and as powerful as the wind in a storm. He had reached midstream, the water tugging at him like the hand of a giant, when his injured leg stiffened. Looking up, Ehren gestured both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way and missed his footing, so that he started sliding down into deeper water and could not stop the motion before his head plunged under. The current wrapped him in a tight embrace and dragged him away. 4 Maggot tumbled, twisted, and bobbed to the surface, gasping for air, so far downstream that Ehren was only a tiny figure in the far distance for one blurred glimpse before the water swirled him under again. This time he tossed, unable to find his way up, until his lungs nearly burst. When his face felt open air, he opened his mouth and drank in all he could breathe and more water than he needed to swallow. The buffeting water had torn the bundle of meat from him, but his quiver and bow were still slung over his shoulder. With his hands free, he paddled toward the far shore, intending to rejoin his new friend. His attempt to swim kept his nose above water, but not much more as the water rushed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned his attention to the dangers he hastened toward. Although he did n't know what waited below, he 'd seen enough rivers to expect falls and rocks somewhere soon. It was as if thinking made it so. The trees on the shore slid by faster than a deer could run. The land began to drop around him and the river roared more quickly, constantly tugging him under again. White spray leapt off boulders ahead, fanning rainbows against the sunny sky. Just before the boulders, storm-washed debris had piled up on a slight bend. Maggot wrestled against the current, winning the contest to come close enough to reach for a tree lodged there. He caught a protruding branch with one hand and pulled himself up with the other. The sudden addition of his weight and momentum tore the log free. It swiftly unhinged from the bank and then went downstream with Maggot clinging to it. The tree absorbed much of the impact as he bounced from one boulder to the next, lifting him up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smashing him into it again. Above the roar of the rapids and his own groans at each shuddering blow, he heard the distant thunder of a waterfall. Just as he was ready to take his chances by grasping at a boulder, the tree lodged between two larger rocks. Gasping for air, Maggot leveraged himself atop it. He had his weight balanced on one knee when the tree rolled, slipped loose, and slammed into another ledge of stone, throwing him free. Empty water surrounded him ; beyond the water were high walls of stone and a noise as solid as a wall as he rushed through it. He flailed, clutching for any handhold, twisting, water pounding into his nose, his throat, gagging him, his eyes blinded, until he did the only thing left to do - he rolled into a ball, his hands covering his head, elbows covering his face. For a half-heartbeat he flew out of the water and a breeze raked needles across his bare skin. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down air. And slammed into water and rock that knocked all the air out of him again. At first he thought he was falling still, but then realized he was sliding, his body shooting down an angled groove cut by the river in the naked mountain stone. Sixty feet or more went by in a second, ripping the bandage off his leg and the quiver from his back and snapping the bow slung over his shoulder. He tensed for the impact at the bottom. Instead he splashed into a deep pool. His feet touched bottom, pushing him up, and his head broke water, arms paddling away from the spray and thunder of the falls. He stretched out his legs when he started to sink and found he could stand and breathe. Though his legs shook like tallgrass in the wind, he staggered toward the shore. He collapsed as soon as he made his way up the bank. Rolled over on his back. Pushed himself upright on his elbows with his head tilted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the river carved a wider, tranquil course through towering hardwoods. When he looked back at the height of the cliff, and the peculiar shape of the falls, which were grooved at an angle out of one solid seam of rock, he knew he 'd been lucky. He even thought he might come back and slide down them again for fun sometime. It would n't be so bad - if he skipped the rapids before the chute. The pieces of his bow floated in the pool. Forcing himself to stand, he ventured out to recover them if only for the bowstring, which he 'd find hard to replace. In the jumble of water below the slide, he also found the quiver, still tightly tied shut although the shoulder strap was missing. Even if the arrows inside were ruined, he still had the steel arrowheads. He could make and fletch new shafts if he needed to, the way Sinnglas and his brothers had taught him. His flint and steel were safe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have those too. His knife was lost, the cord torn from his neck with enough force to tear the skin, though he could n't have said when that happened, - he searched some time without finding it. As he climbed from the pool with both his prizes, the bowstring and arrows, he began to shiver, his skin goosepimpling. Tucking the quiver under his arm, he sought a trail up the cliff. He had to claw for purchase with his hands and his feet. Halfway up, he realized he needed to be on the other side or he would have to cross again at the ford above. Aloud, he mumbled, " Stupid Maggot. " So he descended to the pool again and swam across. It took all his strength to keep his head above the water. Attempting the slope on the other side, he heard a voice, not from upstream, where Ehren might be searching for him, but lower on the river. There were several voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the trees. Without a single decent weapon at hand, Maggot hurried to the top and sought someplace to conceal himself. He considered climbing into a tree, since men seldom looked up as often or as carefully as they should. But his limbs still trembled with the cold, so he chose a crevice in the rocks along the riverbank. After squeezing down into it, he grabbed several fallen branches and dragged them in front of his hiding spot, hoping it would be sufficient. Just as he yanked the last branch into place, a shout came from below. His tracks. He 'd left them all around the pool. Several long moments later, the first of the bearded hunters appeared across the river at the top of the cliff. Maggot could not tell if they were the same men who 'd captured Ehren, or another group, although they were dressed similarly. The hunter looked for trails Upstream, haying mistaken Maggot 's false start for his true path. Then he stopped, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maggot had hidden. Maggot 's skin itched all over. It might be better to take his chances being seen as he ran away from shore rather than get pinned in one spot while they shot arrows at him. He was braced to toss the brush away and pull himself out of his hiding spot, when he heard hard-soled boots scuffing across the stones directly above his head. The hunter across the stream stood with one hand on the hilt of his sword. The two men exchanged a brief argument. Maggot saw only half of it, and understood none of what he heard, but it was n't too difficult to guess what the debate concerned. Above him, the hunter shuffled one of his boots on the stone. The man across the stream shouted angrily, until he grew red in the face, jabbing his finger upstream. Other men appeared on the far cliff, gathering around the leader until there were nine in all. The sun glinted off golden rings hanging from some of their ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another, then fell silent. The leader on the other side waved his hand upstream, and the whole throng continued up the riverbank. If Ehren followed Maggot downstream he was going to blunder right into the men he had so recently escaped. There were some on both sides of the river, though possibly fewer on this side, maybe only one. Maggot was glad, because that might give him a better chance. The sun inched its way toward noon. Maggot, by a lifetime of habit accustomed to patience and moving at night, closed his eyes and rested before he set out to follow them and find Ehren again. He thought it better to wait than to stumble on them from behind, in broad daylight with no bow or blade. But the longer he waited, the more his shaking worsened, until even his teeth chattered. He suspected the rocks, for holding damp and cold. Easing the branches away, he emerged from the shaded crack. But even the bright sun failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed the trail along the riverbank, limping without pretense, hoping that movement would drive away his chill. All the aches and injuries had a wonderful concentrating effect, marshaling reserves of will to fight the periodic flushes of pain and to attack the path ahead of him. Still, by the time he reached the ford where he 'd fallen in, the fever had fastened on him. He knew the symptoms too well. Drinking as much water as his belly could hold, he sought a place to lie up until dark. He found an old tree, a mere husk, ten feet around at the base and completely hollow. He could just barely squeeze his broad shoulders through the crack. Brushing aside the forgotten hoard of some squirrel or other rodent, he cached his own meager possessions within. Then twisting inside, he curled his body up on the dirt floor, pulled the moldy leaves over himself for a blanket, and tried to rest. Like the safety of night itself, rest seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and while dozing, dreamed. But they were fever dreams, the voices of strangers calling out his name. He had the sense of something small gnawing at him, at his joints and flesh, especially his arrow-injured leg, devouring him in little pieces. A million tiny fingers tapped and scraped on the walls of his cave. He wondered where his mother was, and why she did n't bring him something to eat or warm him with her body. When he opened his eyes, everything was dark under a drizzle of rain. A small, furry beast with red eyes and foul breath snapped at him through the crack in the cave, but he drove it back with a handful of arrows. As he jabbed at it, it split into two beasts, then four. He realized that these were the fever beasts, devouring him from the inside out, and he fought harder. The voices became those of other trolls, mocking him for being so small and weak and helpless. At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop of rain, out of his nightmares and back into the deep water of sleep. He woke clutching the arrows. His long black hair lay in tangles over his face. A musty, moldy odor filled the air. He did n't feel rested at all, but that did n't surprise him. Almost no time had passed ; the sun was still in the sky. Then he realized it was the morning sun, and the sky overcast with new clouds. He 'd lost at least a day of time. Yet the fever had broken. He was filthy and his throat was parched, so he went down to the river 's edge. After drinking with the caution of a hunted animal, he cleaned himself. The wound on his left leg was red and swollen. He winced when he touched it - the skin broke and pus flowed out. Gritting his teeth so he would not wince again, he cleaned it as well as he could, scraping it out with one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. He 'd lost too much time. He had no idea where Ehren was, or if he had escaped the men who pursued him. He hoped his new friend was safe. He searched the riverbank, but the rain had erased their tracks. Maggot could find nothing to tell him where the men had gone, or what path they 'd taken. He had nothing more to go on than Ehren 's description of a mountain and a waterfall, which could be anyplace at all between where he was and the populated lands to the east. He could n't find Ehren. He could n't help him either, not against all those hunters, as injured and hungry as he was. " Good luck to you, my friend, " he said softly, in the language of the empire. Then he turned west to avoid all men while he recovered. He became like a troll again, scavenging for things to eat as he traveled. One night became another, filled entirely with moving on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized, and chewed on acorns he found and a few scattered nuts. On the second day, he spied a snake lazing in the sun upon a rock, killed it when it bit into his hand as he grabbed it, and ate it raw. On the fourth, using the arrows as small spears, he waited for hours in the cold water of a marsh to kill a muskrat emerging from its den. It was enough to sustain him. Without knife or bow, unable to run at his full speed, he found the game he would have preferred had nothing to fear from him. He saw deer, and once he came upon a herd of the flatback mammuts gouging mudholes in the soft earth with their long straight tusks. Every day he advanced toward the mountains, far away from the settled lands below, until he reached the first line of peaks. He climbed the highest ridge, and saw beyond them another set of mountains. And down in the valley below, pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. 5 THE CITY LAY some miles away, but the sharp glare of the afternoon sun revealed it clearly. A distinctly square mountain rose in regular steps, surrounded by other geometric peaks. Here and there, through breaks in the canopy, Maggot saw a continuous line snaking around the perimeter of the buildings. So it was a walled city. Bits of bluish white flashed through the enveloping trees, enough to give the impression of a vast settlement. Maggot scratched his head and sniffed the air, curiously. The band of trolls he belonged to with his mother had lived in caves that stretched miles beneath the earth. When he first left his mother and went down into the valleys, he lived with Sinnglas 's people, who had only the simplest of structures, long narrow bowers of bent wood hooded with braided mats or sheets of bark : very cavelike buildings, and comfortable to him. After he met Bran, the two of them journeyed down to the empire 's outpost in the northern mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountains. Just like the city below. He and Bran had been beaten, chased, and locked into a storeroom. Maggot had not cared for his experience there. He almost turned and walked away. If his body ached less, took less will to put in motion, perhaps he would have. He thought that there was something wrong here, a lack of movement, of smoke, of other signs of people. Then he saw a flash of bluish light near one of the structures, and an answering light across the city. If he investigated the outskirts below, he might be able to scavenge new weapons for himself - a knife at least, perhaps a bow. Perhaps find something to eat that he need n't hunt first. Ignoring his misgivings, he headed into the valley. By this time the sun rested low in the sky, spreading butterfly wings of scarlet and gold above the long shadows cast by the valley 's western range. His path had carried him onto a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one side and the city on the other. The city was more difficult to see at this lower elevation. Some of the trees were fifteen and twenty feet in diameter, great poplars reaching up like columns that supported the sky. He found a trail, a deer trail but a trail, that switchbacked through the trees down the cityside of the ridge. Following it, he passed piles of little round pellets - scat - all cold. Farther on, in a narrow place along a steep incline where the trail was worn down to bare dirt, he saw fresh tracks. They were hard to make out in the dusk, so he bent down on his hands and knees. Some of the tracks were five fingers wide - elk, too big for him to take down bare-handed. But mixed among them were smaller prints, three fingers or so. Likely enough, white-tailed deer. He took out an arrow and carried it like a knife in case he was lucky enough to encounter one. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees like a startled bird. Maggot froze, hunkering down. It came from the city, a loud cry that intensified into thunder and ended in a long, low fading rumble. The arrow in his hand felt like a pitiful, inadequate weapon. When the sound stopped, it left behind silence. Maggot stared intently in the direction of the cry, but the darkness of the valley stretched out unbroken before him. He scarcely dared to breathe. One moment passed, and another. Far off, a bird cried whip-poor-will, whip-pooi-will. As he slowly straightened to his feet, there was a rustle on the slope behind him and a slashing fountain of pain as something hit him in the back. The quiver smashed into the nape of his neck and he soared off the trail, tumbling head over heel into brush fifteen or twenty feet below. The branches of the small trees tore at his skin but broke his fall. He dangled upside down for a second, then disentangled his legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, he saw, up on the trail where he 'd been standing, a pair of eyes shine greenish gold in the darkness. A panther. Returning favor for the trick that Maggot had played on its brother. It too must have been stalking the deer. Until it found other prey. Maggot stumbled to his feet, shouting a wordless challenge at it. He 'd lost the arrow, and considered grabbing another from the quiver as he stared up into the panther 's eyes and tried not to blink. He was off-balance on the steep hillside, so he took a step backward for better footing. The panther slid over the lip of the trail, slinking low and fast through the underbrush. Maggot took another step backward and the panther leapt, a tawny blur bursting out of the darkness. Maggot thrust out a hand to catch it by the throat, but its momentum sent them both somersaulting down the hillside to a level spot. They briefly rolled free of one another and then the panther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight on, springing back at it. As the two of them crashed together, he caught a handful of the fur on its face. The two stood toe to toe, Maggot batting away one paw while he thrust his thumbnail into its golden eye. The cat snarled, swinging its head so violently his thumb slipped loose without doing any damage. When it jumped in an attempt to disembowel him with its hind feet, Maggot thrust it away, leaping back from its claws, and they both fell apart again. - Even this close, the cat was little more than a dark shadow crouching among the vague shapes of bushes. The moon had risen early and was hidden behind the rim of the giant trees. Maggot would have. liked more light, anything to give him an advantage. He stared at the panther, and pounded on his chest with cupped hands, beating out the troll 's challenge. " Go away, " he yelled. His voice was hoarse from screaming. For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and padded forward. As it jumped again, Maggot grabbed a wind-blown branch from the ground and swung at the panther 's head. The log cracked over its skull, breaking its stride but no more. The panther shrugged off the effects and stood staring at Maggot from only a few feet away. This was the biggest panther he 'd ever seen, more than match for him. " Run, " Maggot screamed at it, raising the shortened stick to strike another blow. " Run before I kill you! " The panther crouched, as if to pounce. Then it laid back its ears and hissed at Maggot, opening its mouth, showing all of its teeth. All it had to do was fasten one bite " Run away! " he screamed at the animal, stepping toward it and swinging his rude club. His blow whiffed empty air, as the panther turned and disappeared into night. Still tightly gripping the branch, Maggot watched it depart and slowly walked the other direction. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck, where the crushed quiver had absorbed the panther 's first, and otherwise fatal, bite. His other wounds bled and burned, but were not the worst that he 'd ever received. They 'd heal in time. So long as he was not attacked again. He moved from trunk to trunk to take advantage of shelter. He would be safe in the city, at least from the panther. By his estimate, he ought to be nearly on top of buildings by now, but he saw no fires, heard no voices, no barking dogs, nothing. The ground under his feet became rocky, uneven. As he kept a lookout for the panther, a stone shifted beneath his foot and he stumbled. Regaining his balance, he saw around him the remains of a ruined wall. The stone was cold, and perfectly smooth to his touch, a white color veined and clouded with shades of blue. It almost glowed in the dark, where it thrust through the vegetation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapped as they parted. The top layer of stone revealed the sinuous, continuous form of a carved snake. He spun around. He was inside the city but the city was abandoned. The moon shed pale light over the landscape. Fewer trees grew within the circuit of the broken wall. Off to his left lay a long low building. Directly ahead, the manmade mountain rose into the night sky, its squarish bulk rising to a flat top outlined against the stars. Vines and shrubs flooded around the base of it, as if trying to pull it under the surface of the forest to drown. Other mounds surrounded it, too difficult to count in the night. Some appeared blockish, as if made of stone, while others were rounded. Ranged between Maggot and the great, squat tower, was a broad plaza with some sort of low mound in the center. Surrounding it, he saw the silent shadows of a herd of deer. He could just make out the new sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panther behind him, Maggot began to creep toward the deer. A group of four animals grazed slightly apart from the rest. One was a fawn, a tiny thing, and one of the other does was swollen. She must have been almost ready to deliver ; she could hardly walk. Pulling another arrow from his quiver, Maggot chose therri for his prey. He 'd try to separate the fawn, or run down the pregnant doe. He darted from a pile of rubble to a hiding place behind a tree, angling to get between them and the main group. Almost as an afterthought, he looked up. All the new, tender young leaves were stripped from the branches, maybe as high as twenty feet - it was hard to tell. Not a single branch of the tree was spared. The trunk itself was split open, and the heartwood chewed out like pith from a stem of grass. This must have been done by whatever animal made the frightening scream earlier. Maggot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of deer jerked their heads up. One of them emitted a high-pitched whistle and ran toward the safety of the larger group. As he turned his attention away from possible danger to his present hunger, he saw a low rectangular pool in the center of the plaza. Water trickled from animal-shaped fountains carved in a wall at one end. The deer gathered on the far side on this pool, around a tufted mound of earth. While he watched, the mound of earth stood up and moved. Shaped like a bear, but more than twice a bear 's size, it walked slothfully, but intentionally, in his direction, trailed by a small but visible cloud of buzzing insects that stirred the air as it moved. A vast stench rose from the beast. Maggot 's empty stomach clenched and he retched. The creature stood up on its hind legs and staggered toward the noise to investigate. The thing was twenty feet tall, front paws tipped with claws the size of sabers. It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had voiced earlier. Maggot did the only sensible thingi He turned and ran. He 'd not taken ten strides toward the outer wall when he saw something that made him come to a complete stop. Ehren. Dressed in the clothes of the hunters. And he had a bow and arrow aimed at Maggot as if he meant to shoot him. 6. EHREN 'S GAZE twitched toward the renewed keening of the weird creature, giving Maggot a chance to dodge aside as the arrow was released. It whizzed past him. Before taking another shot, Ehren spun and dashed for the nearest building. Maggot raced after him. It could be no coincidence that he was also here in this abandoned city, and Maggot wanted to find out why. Besides, he ran away from the shaggy giant, and that was the same direction Maggot headed. The stone buildings promised some shelter impassable to the beast 's great bulk. The animal 's scream wavered in the air, and plummeted through the scale to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground, and his weight thumped after Maggot while the scream echoed off the stone structures. For a second, he mistook the echo off the wall ahead as an answering cry and his skin crawled. Glancing back over his shoulder, he saw the creature stop its chase. In that moment he lost sight of Ehren. The building ahead was long, straight, and narrow, and open along the side facing Maggot. A row of columns, more than a troll could ever count, supported the roof on the open side ; below them a continuous row of wide, shallow steps went down from the platform into a grassy area thick with trees. The building stretched off into the shadows beyond the edge of the plaza, to an area surrounded by smaller mounds. Maggot dodged behind a tree, in case Ehren meant to shoot him again. Slowly he peered out again. The evenly spaced columns on the building might have seemed impressively thick and tall until one compared them with the randomly scattered trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been empty for centuries. Moving from tree to tree, up the steps, to a column, Maggot neither saw nor heard - nor, wrinkling his nose reflexively like a troll, smelled - any sign of Ehren. He moved cautiously along the building, aware again of the fresh aches in his body overlying the old. He wondered why Ehren had tried to shoot him. Had it been a mistake? Did he mean to shoot the beast instead? Why, when he needed food and rest, could he find neither? In a section of the building where the roof had caved in, crushed by falling trees or weakened where columns had tipped beneath some shifting weight, in the shadows beside the rubble, Maggot paused. He wanted Ehren. Sometimes the best way to flush a prey was to remain still. Maggot quietly mounted a pile of debris sheltered by a more intact piece of overhanging roof, and then he sat there, wrapped in deep nocturnal shadow. He could see in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undamaged length of the building ahead, out across the grove of trees across the plaza, and over the jumbled piles of stone behind him. His fingers plied in the dirt of leaf mold covering the stones, smearing it across his face to reduce the shine from his eyes. His huge right hand rested on the rock he intended to use as a weapon. And he waited. A few birds called out. One of the deer made a barking sound. The half-circle of the moon floated silently in the sky and the stars formed a luminous river. A little blood trickled from a broken scab on his back where the panther had cut him. One drop rolled slowly down his spine, followed by another, both of them pooling, cool, around the cloth at his waist. He did not move even his head, but looked only out of the corners of his eyes. A vague shape detached itself from one of the trees, looking in the direction of the pool, and paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his throw. The shadow moved on - only another of the deer. From the direction he 'd come, there was a clatter of gravel and a thud as some piece of fallen masonry shifted and resettled. He remained motionless, tensed to spring. The stillness extended until it seemed to grow as long as the building. He relaxed, only to find his muscles, especially in his wounded left leg, too sore to loosen completely. Maggot reluctantly admitted to himself that Ehren had kept moving. But how had he tracked Maggot this far, and why? It was opposite the direction he 'd said he was going. As he squatted there, thinking about all of it - the panther attack, that weird beast protecting the plaza, and now Ehren, his legs began to tremble. He released an audible breath and stilled them. He really had no idea how badly the big cat had hurt him ; he 'd had no time to examine himself. But his face, and neck, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, water, someplace to hide and recover his strength. A small stone careened off the wall beyond the rows of undisturbed columns, and pattered to a stop somewhere on the marble platform below Maggot 's perch. " Ehren, after all. A feint to make him move. Maggot gripped the rock with his right hand and waited. He peered down the long corridor between the columns. Still crouching low, he shifted the rock for a better grip. Ehren skulked toward him then, sprinting from column to column and peering beyond them out into the darkness away from Maggot, until he 'd come within thirty feet. Maggot slowly hefted the stone to throw it. He would use it as a hammer if the other man came close enough. One more column would do it, but before Ehren took that step, he drew something from the pouch at his waist, the one he 'd taken from the camp. He lifted it toward the plaza, and whispered a few unintelligible words. A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd seen from the hillside. An answering flash, from within the pyramid, muted, but from a much larger source, reflecting from a hole. Maggot 's slight gasp must have startled the other man too. Ehren staggered backward from the pillar and stared straight up the mound of debris at Maggot 's hiding place. With a shout, Maggot pounced, leap landing into dash as he swung at the other man 's skull. Ehren lurched sideways, but the stone glanced off his head and sent him crashing to the floor. Maggot hit the ground, losing his weapon on impact, but rolled to his feet ready to fight. As Ehren lay stunned, Maggot rose to his full height, drumming the " danger, death " tattoo of the trolls on his bare chest. A second later, the echo of it returned from the direction of the pyramid across the plaza. The shape of the building altered the sound. With a bow and knife Maggot would have no problem finding game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his weapons. As soon as his hands touched the knife belt, Ehren 's hands shot up to grasp his wrists. Maggot pulled away, but Ehren kicked him, sent him sprawling. Instead of drawing his weapon to attack Maggot, he searched the floor to snatch up something he 'd dropped - the shining stone. He found it as Maggot staggered to his feet. Ehren did not stay to fight, but ran away, sprinting through the screen of trees toward the pyramid. Maggot pursued him, wondering why a man would chase him so far only to flee. Ehren was fleet, at fast as Maggot, and not so weakened by recent injuries. He stretched out the distance between them, drawing his sword as he ran. They dodged between the mounds, avoiding the pool, the deer, and their strange guardian. Ehren ducked behind the few ancient trees, but Maggot stayed after him. He tripped as he tried to leap a fallen tulip poplar, a tree so large it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fell. Maggot grunted as he hit the ground and rolled back to his feet. Ehren ascended the pyramid, up one of the flights of narrow, flat steps cut into each side of the structure, flanked by stylized creatures carved from stone. He turned and pointed his sword at Maggot. " Go away, before I must kill you! " Ehren said. The accent was thick, but the words the language of the empire, the language that Maggot had spoken to him. Why had he pretended not to know it? Had he understood all along? " You were my friend! " Maggot said. He was angry beyond understanding. He wanted to smash Ehren, to crush him. " The Jewel is within my reach and once I have it - " Maggot roared and jumped for the corner platform, pulling himself up onto the first level of the structure. He had no clear intention other than getting higher than Ehren. He leapt, gripping the lip of the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knee scraped over the edge of the stone he rushed to the next flat wall and did the same. Ehren stumbled up the narrow steps, peering over the shoulders of the stone guardians, yelling in some incomprehensible tongue. When Maggot reached the fifth platform, his shoulders aching, he rounded the corner of the building, out of Ehren 's line of vision, and vaulted the figures lining the stairs. Taking three steps in a stride, slipping, then two, still favoring his bad leg, he sprung to the broad flat top of the structure and met Ehren as he reached the peak. Maggot tackled him, catching his wrist and slamming it against the stone altar that occupied the middle of the platform. Sword clanged on marble, ringing as it skittered loose. But the other man clutched Maggot tightly as the two rolled to the edge and fell off.. They tumbled through the air, Ehren landing on top as they hit the level below. Maggot grunted, losing his grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrambled up the steps, Maggot grabbed his heel and yanked. Both men toppled backward, falling apart. Maggot smacked his left elbow on a corner of stone, hitting the bone that made his arm go tingly and numb. Ehren rolled past Maggot and cracked his head, crying out. He sat up clutching one hand to his temple. When he looked up at Maggot, his eyes went wide with fright and he started slipping feet first down the stairs. Maggot rose, cradling his elbow and grimacing as the throbbing subsided. He followed a step or two after Ehren, not understanding the other man 's blind panic as he skidded, fell, regained his feet, and jumped blindly from the base of the structure to go running off into the night. Too exhausted, too weary and hungry to chase after him how and face yet another fight, Maggot decided to retrieve the sword dropped on the top of the platform. As he turned around, he half-saw, half-sensed some new danger, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him flat to the stone. His first thought was the panther, that it had returned. He twisted immediately, raising his hands in defense. And saw above him, squatting on the next ledge, a lanky-armed shetroll. 7. MAGGOT GRINNED at his good fortune. She was about his own age. The protruding brow, deep eyes, and sharp slope of her head gave her a. penetrating, intelligent appearance. Her height must have been close to eight feet, though it was hard to tell when she was seated on her haunches. She had broad shoulders and a nice round belly. Her thick, hard, and nearly hairless skin was a beautiful dark slate color. There was a big rock at the end of one of her arms, poised to smash him. He stuck his tongue out, like he had just eaten something that tasted awful. It was the troll expression for no, but lest she not understand he added, " Do n't hit me, I 'm a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rock into the air as she jumped back. " It talks! " " Of course I talk, " Maggot laughed, ducking as the stone landed with a crack and chips of it flew in his direction. " Aaaaahh! " she screamed, retreating around the corner of the pyramid, and climbing to a higher level. She stopped, craning her neck out to see him, as though she half-expected him to disappear. He sat up, smacking his lips. " Got anything to eat? " It was a traditional troll greeting among strangers. Since this was her territory, she, should have offered first, but he asked anyway. He was hungry. Her brow ridge twitched like a snake caught in a hawk 's talons, until she stuck out her tongue and shook her head for an answer. Then she turned, screaming, and loped lengthways across the steps on three limbs, slapping the top of her head with her big, flat hand. " Wait! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monument 's sides, but when he rounded the corner a moment later she was gone. He looked up the steps and saw nothing. The pool stretched out like a long, dark hole below. On the far side of it he saw the shaggy mound of the big-clawed creature, and heard the cracks as it stood on its hind legs to tear a branch from a tree. But there was no sign of her among the deer or anywhere below. On the next ledge, however, he saw a rough hole. He jumped down to investigate and found himself standing before a broken wall that led into the carved mountain. Eyes peered out at him from within, a pair of ovoid amber gems that glinted in the faint light. He crouched non-threateningly, leaning forward on both arms. " Hello, " he said, politely tapping his chin with his fingers. " My name 's Maggot, of Deep Caves Band. " It was a truth of sorts. His mother had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and the other trolls " lack of acceptance, so that he had no real band as a child. But that was an odd thing, as usually trolls wandered for only a few seasons upon reaching adulthood. And wherever they went, the two of them had been known as " that troll and her animal, from Deep Caves Band. " The troll stepped forward until Maggot could see her face. Her large nostrils dilated, sniffing quizzically, then squeezed shut in disbelief. She leaned back, and slapped her face repeatedly with both hands, then bent her neck forward to look at him again. " Hello, " he repeated., " Goaway! " " What 's your name? " She took another tripedal step forward and then sat down. " Holly. " " Hello, Holly. " He hunkered back on his haunches, resting his arms on his knees. Trolls were slow thinkers, and he 'd learned to get on well by not rushing them. She sniffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? " he prompted. " Your name is Maggot? " " Ragweed, Windy 's mate, he named me that because I was small and white and they found me crawling on a dead body. " " Hee! " She grinned, rocking in amusement. : " Windy was my mother, a troll from Deep Caves Band many nights " travel north of here. She 's the one who found me when I was a baby and she raised me as her own. " She snorted. " Sometimes I hear things that are n't really there. The voices of other trolls echoing from the ridges. Tonight, when I heard the warning beat, " she lifted her knuckles and tapped the tattoo on her chest, " I thought I was hearing things again. But that was you. " " Yes. " " I made the greeting call when I heard you. " She thumped out another pattern. " Why did n't you answer me? " " I did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard it wrong, that it was the sound of my own warning coming back to me. My thoughts were elsewhere, on the man I chased. " " That other man? " Like a turn in a deep cave, that suddenly took him out of the light and into total darkness, Maggot had a realization. He 'd forgotten who he was for a moment. She saw him only as a man and not as a troll. The trolls he 'd grown up around had eventually come to see him for himself, as part of their bands even if he was n't like them. But she did n't. She could n't. " The other man, " he answered. " I need help catching him. Where 's the rest of your band? If you take me to your First, I can explain why. He can ask for a vote. " " There are no other trolls. " " What? " " No other trolls, only Holly. " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forth between her big flat palms, until she stopped to stare at him again. " Crazy Holly, who hears things and sees things. Lonely Holly. " " Why do n't you return to your Band? " asked Maggot. " For winter after winter after winter after winter, Holly is the Band, Holly is the First. Holly is a band of one. " " What happened to the others? " She made a sour face, sticking out her tongue several times in a row. " I do n't know. We were Piebald Mountain Band, just nine of us there at the end. The summer before winter before winter before winter before winter - " " Four winters past, " said Maggot. Adding things precisely was very important to trolls, as was verifying the number, because everything a band did as a whole was decided by a vote. " You can add? " she said incredulously. Her voice lost the slow cadence used by trolls when talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him sideways. " I did n't know if you could count, that 's all. You - " " I belonged to Deep Cave Band, before I started wandering. " It was common for trolls of a certain age to wander a year or two, perhaps visiting other bands in search of mates. He did n't mention that he had gone wandering in search of people. " How was I supposed to know you could count? " she said finally, but mostly to herself. " So you understand then? My friend Myrtle and I went wandering away from the band the summer before four winters ago, looking for mates. There were no unmated men in our group. They were all old men. " Maggot grunted, rapping his knuckles on the ground in acknowledgment. " And then? " She started rocking, and sucked on her knobby fingertips briefly before she continued. " We did n't find anybody. I do n't know what it 's like in the north, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over them, and passing through them all the time, and we found traces of people everywhere but no other trolls. " " It 's the same where I come from. A lot of sickness too, a coughing sickness, caught from people. " " Yes, that 's what it 's been like. We had a hard time finding carrion, because animals scavenged first. Food was hard to find, harder than it is now. So one night Myrtle and I stayed out too long. We lost each other, and she did n't meet me back at the cave before dawn. I sniffed for her every night for weeks and could n't find a scent. She was just gone. When I finally returned to our home to get help, the Band was gone too. No odor to indicate where they 'd gone or why. " The final words trailed off. She continued rocking. Her nostrils were flared wide open.? Maggot grunted again. " That 's worse than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " " Now Holly lives here all alone, in these people caves. " " So you 've been here for a while? " " Since midwinter, four winters back, when I was searching for my band. It 's not a bad place. You see Big Stinky? " She waved a thick finger in the direction of the tree-eating giant. " Yes. " Big Stinky was a good name for the beast. " He does n't bother me much. When the lions come in, or the wolves, they might kill a deer, but Big Stinky chases them off. Then I get to eat what 's left. Sometimes he kills a lion or a wolf, rips them open with those big claws if they come too close. Then I 've got that to eat too. I ate four wolves last winter, and a lion the summer before that, and a deer about three moons back after Big Stinky chased off - " " Holly, " Maggot interrupted softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoard here? People things you 've gathered? " She stared at him suspiciously. Trolls treasured their hordes, counting the items over and over again, comparing their counts with each other. " What kind of things? " " Shiny, sharp things. Big claws, to fit in my hand. Little claws on ends of branches, that I can send flying through the air. " He needed to give her a reason. " With them I can bring us fresh meat. " She perked up, rubbing her belly. " I 've only eaten meat once since the last no-moon. " Then her joy subsided, and her shoulders sunk again. " But I do n't have any people things. " Maggot sighed. It was too much to hope for. She bent forward, sniffing and peering closely at. his shoulders. " What 's been eating you? " she asked. He touched the blood caked on his face and neck. " A panther. He tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no easy meal. " She smacked her lips vigorously. " That 's the truth. " " I need your help, Holly. " " Me? " " It 'll take two trolls to do it. " " There 's only two of us here. " " That 's the truth of it. " He picked up a piece of stone and tapped it on the weather-worn rock. By troll custom, he ought to groom her as he asked the favor, picking over her skin for ticks and other parasites. But he thought she was still too skittish to approach that closely. " That other man? " " Other man? Oh. The man who fought you. " " That man, yes. I need your help to find and catch him. I thought he was a friend of mine, but he just tried to kill me. " " A friend? " She stood up, walked in a wide circle, slapping her hands on her chest. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands on the terrace, right in front of him, baring her teeth. " You said he was your friend, but if he 's no troll, then you 're no troll. " Her hot breath washed over his face, but Maggot did n't flinch. " You 're my friend too, Holly. Does that mean you 're no troll? " " Ai! " This confused her. She threw her arms up in the air, spun, returned to her original spot, and sat down again. " Sometimes I think Holly is no troll. There are no more trolls. Only loneliness. " " I 've felt that way too. " She preened the wrinkles on her face and said nothing. It was getting late into the night. She 'd have to seek cover before dawn, or be turned to stone by the sun. If he was going to get her help it 'd have to come soon. He wanted the man 's weapons more than anything. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you fresh meat. " Her head lifted. " Meat? " " Let 's take a vote, " Maggot said. " Everyone who wants to catch the man first, and then eat fresh meat, raise a hand. " He held his up in the air. After a second 's hesitation she raised her hand too. " Let 's go get him then. " Maggot rose, his muscles aching as they unbent and stretched. He hoped that Holly 's help would be enough. Because while he was sitting here, he 'd realized what the flash of light meant. Ehren was a wizard. Maggot had met wizards before, had seen them bespell demons and use their charms to shake the earth. This would be the first time he went hunting one. 8. MAGGOT TRUDGED to the structure 's peak to retrieve the sword. He should not have squatted so long. He should have gone immediately to get some water to drink. But he did, and he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holly followed him. A cool breeze swept over the broad, square platform. She lifted her head to the wind and sniffed. Maggot felt the balance of the weapon. It was short, leaf-shaped, with the tip a good weight for thrusting. More to his liking than the longer swords Bran had tried to teach him to use. He looked out from the height and imagined that one could watch the entire valley from here. His admiration for the people who 'd built this edifice increased in proportion. " Do you smell anything interesting? " " Cherry blossoms, over that way. " She licked her lips, leaned on her knuckles, and took a few steps toward the edge of the platform. " A couple months, they 'll be ripe to eat. " " What about the man? " " Him too, " she said. " Can you lead me to him? " She snorted. " Are n't people easy to smell? I sniffed it earlier. Knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning to let me know it was here. " Maggot considered this. So the stranger was an it and he was n't? He thought about asking her to explain the difference, but he knew the answer, having heard it from others so many times before. You 're not like them. You 're not a troll, but you 're not a man either. He thought about confessing that his display was n't an attempt to warn her, because he had n't known she was there. But he decided not to. Better not to antagonize her, not when he needed her help. " Where is he? " Maggot asked, with the slightest stress on the last word. " Beyond the cave of stone trees, over by the nine mound. Or the four mound, if you 're counting from the other direction. " " Good. Can you lead me there? I 'll draw him out, get his attention on - " literally, in the troll 's language, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then what? " - " Can you jump on him, pin him to the ground? Like you were wrestling him. " " Sure. " She smacked her lips eagerly, then furrowed her brow. " Will it be that easy? ", " No. Probably not. " She waited for him to explain. " If he 's not drawn out, then we go back down the cliff and look for a new route to the top. " An old troll saying. " If he comes out and attacks me, then you jump on him from your hiding place, just like we said. If he turns on you, I 'll bite him hard with this tooth. " He held up the sword. " How does that smell? " She grinned. " Like rotten meat. " " Good, " he smiled back. " I 'm glad you like it. Now you show me where he is. Let 's go quietly. Remember that people hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his mouth without thinking. What was he? A person or a troll? Was he one thing with Bran or Ehren, and another with his mother or Holly? Big Stinky and his herd of deer grazed farther away, under the trees. They left behind them a swath of shredded vegetation. The ground was torn out, the little trees were stripped bare, and the big trees were shorn of lower branches. Maggot saw suddenly how the plaza, and the area around the mounds, remained clear. He went down to the pool for a drink. The bottom was thick with muck ; even if he did not stir the water, it was unfit to drink. " Do n't fall in, " Holly warned him. " Do n't worry, " Maggot said. " It has no bottom. Anything you toss in there sinks and sinks and sinks, no matter how big. " " That 's not possible, " Maggot said. " I upended a tree trunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said, indicating the giants that rose two hundred feet into the sky. " But big. It sank down and down and disappeared until nothing showed. " With that, she knelt by the edge and cupped big handf uls of water into her mouth, until it ran down her neck and across her breasts. Maggot walked to the fountain in the wall at the end of the pool. Four squat creatures, strange mixtures of familiar beasts, toad and lion and eagle, like the statues that lined the steps upon the pyramid, were carved in the wall where the hillside met the pool. Their heads were raised at various levels, with holes for mouths. Water trickled out of one of them, though by cracks and stains it appeared that it had come from the others too at one time. Maggot stepped out on the sculpture 's feet, and sipped from its mouth. " Giving it a kiss? " Holly giggled, making a sound like gravel rolling down a hillside. Maggot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He saved himself by grabbing onto the monster 's stone tooth, but Holly laughed, as loud as a landslide. She pursed her wide lips, as if kissing, and giggled again. He jumped back to the shore. There was nothing he could do about the noise now. And the wizard already knew they were there. " That was good, " he said quietly, wiping his mouth on his arm. " Not as good as something to eat, " Holly said, rubbing her stomach. She looked to the east and sniffed the air. " Sun the Killer will be coming soon. " Maggot acknowledged this. " Let 's go. Show me where he 's hiding. " Holly looked at him seriously. " You act like the First. " He turned and led the way, as though he was. He 'd tried to become the First in Deep Cave Band, to do what he could to save his mother and those around her, but he 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterward he 'd left. How strange to be First now in this Band of the Lost. They snaked their way through the irregularly spaced mounds. The big structures made the size of the city deceptive. It was larger than he had guessed. They came to a low structure in another open area, a stone platform with tiers of broad flat steps on one side. The top contained a rectangular building, open with columns facing the steps. Hiding behind a small group of prickly shrubs, oblique to the open front, Holly sniffed the ground and the air several times. " He 's in there, " she whispered, in a voice as loud as Maggot 's normal tone. " Are you certain? " She pressed her lips together quietly. It looked more like a kiss than a yes. " Can you sneak around behind, and climb on top of the building? " " I 've done it before. But why? There 's nothing up there. " " Because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to jump on him. " Her. nostrils flared. " That 's a good idea. " " If he does n't come out, then we 'll meet back here and make a new plan. " This time her mouth was unmistakably kissy. He ignored it. " I 'll give you a few moments to go, and then I 'll approach the front until he notices - " literally, until he smells - " me coming. " She crept away quickly. Even before he saw her dark bulk ease onto the stone roof, he walked toward the main entrance. He stopped at the bottom of the steps. " Are you awake in there, Ehren? " No reply came from the darkness. Maggot stepped up onto the first, then the second platform, calling again. " Could you pass some wind, please, just to let me know you 're there? " He stepped up two more of the platforms. The top of his head now rose high enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sword in front of him, he ascended to the penultimate step below the platform. Close enough that the wizard could n't miss him but still not close enough for his eyes to penetrate the complete darkness beneath the roof, not with the moon down. He avoided glancing up to see if Holly was perched there. " Hey, wizard. If you intend to use your magic against me, come out and do it. I ca n't stop you. " To his surprise, he heard a sudden shifting inside the edifice. A second later, Ehren appeared beside one of the columns. His bow was drawn, the pale wood curving in the shadows like a crescent moon. An arrow pointed straight at Maggot 's chest, from not more than fifteen feet away. " You 're a better swimmer than I would have guessed, " he said. " Who sent you to follow me? " " Why did you follow me here? " Maggot demanded. " Me, follow you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrow just a bit as he did. " Why did n't you answer when I spoke to you before? " " You spoke the Snake - tongue! " There was a word there Maggot did n't understand, any more than he understood the reference. He stuck his tongue way out of his mouth and wiggled it. " It 's not a snake tongue. No fork. see? " Ehren tensed, jerking the bow up toward Maggot 's voice. " Mockery and lies-just what I expect from someone speaking the Snake-tongue. " " You speak it too, " Maggot said, sidling over after he spoke this time. " Do you mock and lie also? " " Stay where you are and answer my questions! " Ehren inched forward, almost out of the shadow of the doorway. " Here is your sword, " Maggot said. He set it down on the top step, right at the very edge, letting it clink against the. stone. " You dropped it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What are you doing? " " You dropped your sword, " Maggot said, backing down the steps. As his head dropped below the other man 's line of vision, Ehren came forward again. " Wait! Where are you going? " " Away from that arrow, " Maggot answered. Three things happened at once : Maggot retreated down the steps, Ehren ran forward, and Holly leapt from the roof, smashing the wizard to the upper terrace. Maggot bounded up the steps and found her sitting on Ehren. He was conscious, but too terrified to struggle. His eyes were wide with terror. As Maggot approached, Ehren slowly stretched out one hand toward the knife at his belt. Holly slapped it down like she was swatting an insect. The man held back his cry, but cringed. When he saw Maggot, he spat. " You animal! " " Does it talk too? " Holly asked, her brow wrinkled as if she were trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it saying? " " He just called me an animal, " Maggot answered, not taking his eyes from Ehren 's. She snorted. " That 's funny. It called you an animal. " It was and he was n't? Maggot said nothing. Ehren glared at him. " You can speak with that creature? Do you have it bespelled, like one of your demon-snakes? " " No snakes, " Maggot replied, switching languages. He wiggled his tongue again. " How do you know this language? " Before the other man could answer, Holly spoke. " Hey, Maggot? " " Yes? " " You promised meat. " " I did. " " Well, " she said, grabbing Ehren 's head in her big knobby-knuckled hand and turning it from side to side like someone examining a pumpkin while he screamed. " Do you want to take the first bite or can I? I 'm hungry. " " We are n't going to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeezed Ehren 's head until his screaming stopped. All she needed to do was tighten her grip and it would pop open. " You promised me. " " I promised you fresh meat. I meant deer meat. With his bow - " literally, his killing smile, so-called for the shape of it seen sideways - " I can catch a deer for us. Venison will taste much sweeter than his meat. " She grimaced doubtfully. " Have you ever eaten people before? " She thrust out her tongue. Maggot mimicked the gesture. " You do n't want to. It tastes terrible. " He did n't know this - he 'd never tasted human flesh, and was n't about to, any more than one troll would eat another. Nor was he about to lose his only source of information - why had Ehren pretended to be his friend, then tried to kill him? " I do n't want to wait until tomorrow night to eat, " she pouted. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is your cave big enough to hold all of us? " The word for all of us was the same as the word for band. " Oh, yes. It 's not large enough to hold the entire band though. My old band, that is. " " Good. I 'll tie him up and we 'll put him in there. Then I 'll go get some meat for you. " She let go of Ehren 's head, and it bounced off the stone. He groaned, shook it off, and looked up at Maggot, almost hopefully. " What were you talking about? " " She wants to rip off your head and suck your brains out through your neck, " Maggot answered, removing a rope looped at the man 's waist. Ehren snorted one desperate laugh. When Maggot did n't change expression, he twisted his head, eyes flicking anxiously at Holly 's massive form. " That 's not wholly true, " Maggot admitted, as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg and wrapped the rope tightly around it. " They do n't really suck the brains out. They use their tongues to scoop them out. You ever see a troll 's tongue at work? " Ehren struggled, futilely. " If you wish to kill me for your Snake Queen, " - that was the word Maggot did n't understand before ; he wondered what a queen was - " then do it. But do n't mock me this way. " " I 'm not mocking, " said Maggot, shifting to the other side to bind that arm. " I 've seen trolls do that to a head before. " He stopped struggling. " And you would leave me to one of these monsters? " Maggot finished tying the man 's hands behind his back, then he patted Holly on the shoulder and she rose. He jerked his prisoner to his feet. " No, if you tell me why you followed me here, I 'll spare your life. " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier surprise. Holly licked her lips loudly and made an impatient slurping noise. Ehren 's legs trembled, and Maggot had to prop him up. " Maybe, " Maggot added judiciously. 9. THEY WALKED in silence back to the pyramid, shoving Ehren ahead of them. Holly sniffed the air nervously. It was still and very cold. Morning could not be too far off. " You ca n't let it eat me, " Ehren protested as Maggot pushed him up the stairs. " We are both men, not monsters like that thing. " " She is no monster, " Maggot said angrily, shoving him ahead, all the while Holly was asking, " What 's it saying, huh, Maggot? Huh? What 's it saying now? " Holly 's cave inside the huge stone mound faced the northwest corner. The entrance was part of a false wall, not a door, it appeared to Maggot. A thin skin of marble had cracked and been enlarged. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's waste, penetrated the structure and went around a corner. Just past the bend, a narrow doorway opened into a small chamber that smelled heavily of troll. Ehren gagged at the odor. Maggot stripped the wizard - if that 's indeed what Ehren proved to be - and found a bag containing pieces of hard, dried meat. He smelled it, licked it, tasting the salt, and then bit into it. He had to jerk his head sideto-side to break a piece off, but it softened up as he chewed it. " Meat, " he said, offering a piece to Holly. She snatched it eagerly from his hand, put it in her mouth, then spit it out again. It flew down the corridor like a miniature arrow and clicked when it hit stone. " Yuck! You call that meat? I 've eaten old bones that tasted better. " " I 'll take the bow and go find something for us. " " Do n't go! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " " I can travel in the sunlight, Holly. " She snorted disdainfully, and moved around on her haunches as if she could n't get comfortable, but she did n't say any more. Sorting through the rest of the man 's possessions, Maggot found a crystal that filled his fist, glowing faint blue and seeming to pulse as if it had its own slow heartbeat. An uneasy shiver ran through his bones, and he shoved it back into Ehren 's bag. " I 'll tie his legs together too. " " I 'll make sure it does n't leave, " Holly promised. There were several ways to understand that comment. Maggot did n't ask for explanations ; he cut off a length of rope and bound the man 's ankles. " Why are you doing this? " Ehren asked. " I have to go out for a short time, " Maggot answered. " Do n't leave me here alone with that monster, " he begged in a husky whisper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Holly shifted uncomfortably. " What 's all that squeaking mean? It 's as bad as a squirrel. Chittei, chittei, chittei. " " It means nothing, " Maggot said. " Then tell it to block the cave - " to shut his mouth - " because I 'm tired. I want to sleep, and I do n't need any squeaking keeping me awake. " Ehren twisted in Maggot 's grasp. " What 's it saying? " " She says if you say another word, she wo n't keep her promise to me to leave your skull alone. If I were you, I 'd lie here very still and pretend I was dead. " His eyes grew large, and he stiffened at once. " She wo n't eat you if she thinks you 're dead, " he lied. He hoped Ehren did n't know that trolls preferred their meat already dead. Turning, he said to Holly, " I 'll return as soon as I can. You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " If I do n't get too hungry, " she said. And then, grabbing Ehren by the arms tied behind his back, she picked him up and dragged him into a corner of the tiny chamber. " Remember, " Maggot called out. " Be quiet. Play dead and she wo n't eat you. " In trollish, " I 'll be back soon. " He exited the broken wall and stood out on the platform, armed with Ehren 's weapons. The sky was noticeably bluer. He hated leaving Ehren alone with Holly. Worse, he hated going off to hunt without first cleaning his wounds and getting some rest. But he had a promise to keep, and there was no telling what Holly might do if she did n't eat. One deer could give Holly meat to gorge over a couple of days, but he 'd be better off seeking something small instead ; he did n't have the strength to drag anything large back to the pyramid or up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slope where the panther lurked and the direction in which he 'd last seen Big Stinky. Limping down the steps, he headed out of the dead city and into the broad valley. As the land narrowed, sloping down toward a thin trickle of a stream, he saw dark round shapes huddled on branches about fifteen feet high. Gobble-birds. He drew his bow and shot at the largest target. It squawked, spreading its wings as it fell off the branch. There were sudden cries of gobble gobble gobble as the other birds flew ponderously to the ground and took off running in all directions. The wounded bird flapped around in a frenzy, rolling down the muddy bank, and into the stream. Maggot dispatched it quickly. It was a good-sized bird, close to thirty pounds. Its black feathers had a bronze sheen to them. The skin that hung from its beak was pale blue. As he carried his prize back toward the pyramid, songbirds began their morning carols. Dawn, tinged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east, beyond the city and behind the mountains. The two miles back seemed to take much longer to hike than on the way out, but it gave him time to think. Talking again - both to Holly, who reminded him of his childhood friends and acquaintances, and to Ehren, who had reminded him of his friends Sinnglas and Bran - confused Maggot. Whatever he 'd gone looking for when he fled the imperial city, he had not found it. He climbed the steps of the pyramid as day spread feathery white clouds like wings across the light blue sky. He had lived in both daylight and darkness, but to which did he belong? Holly 's snores rumbled in the stone tunnel like a spinning wind. He stepped over her, dropping the gobble-bird by her side, and went to see the prisoner. Maggot 's eyes had not adjusted to the darkness yet, so he could see almost nothing. " Praise the snake demon, " Ehren whispered. " You return, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? " Maggot asked. " I thought you meant me to die here. " " Perhaps I still do. " The questions bubbled up like a fountain he could no longer contain. " Why were you following me? How did you trail me here? Tell me, tell me three times, and tell me true. " Ehren turned his head and spat suddenly. Then leaned his chin forward as if he meant to take back the spit. He glanced sideways at Maggot, then slowly turned his head. " Forgive me. I just praised your false god, in joy at seeing you, so I do n't know why I should have reacted so to your perfidious custom. It is clear you do not know any better. " Maggot stretched out on the floor and laid his head upon his arm. " Speak when you have something to tell me. Until then, do not disturb me. " " Wait. " Maggot closed his eyes. " I 'm listening. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands in front, damn you - my arms have gone numb. " It went against Maggot 's nature to confine creatures or hurt them for amusement. With one hand he reached around and found Ehren 's fingers were cool to his touch. He 'd knotted the ropes too tight. The other man sighed and untensed his shoulders as soon as Maggot loosed the first knot. Wiggling his fingers, Ehren said softly, " What does the Snake Queen want in these lands? Does she seek the Jewel? Tell me the truth, and I will see you rewarded with wealth beyond your greediest desire. " Maggot only heard the name of the Snake Queen. " I ate a snake the other day. One of the black ones with stripes. " " You mock me again. " " You ask too many questions. What is the Jewel? " E " The jewel of Arop, " Ehren said. " You two are as loud as thunder, " Holly grumbled, sounding drowsy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon? " " Sorry, " Maggot answered. " We 'll keep it down. " " What did it say, " Ehren whispered, almost too soft for Maggot to hear. " She asked if your brains were ready to eat yet. I told her they were still warming up. " With Ehren 's hands half-untied, Maggot thought of the crystal in his bag and reached for it. " Meat! " Holly said, across the room. " Oh, Maggot. Thank you! " " I was glad to hunt it for you, " he answered. Across the dark cell, the bird 's ribs cracked as she turned it inside out and started chewing. She spit out some feathers. There were slurping sounds as her tongue cleaned out the stuff inside. Ehren shuddered. " Why did you follow me here? " Maggot asked him, fingers sifting the bag. He could hear Ehren working lose his bounds, saving him the trouble of untying them. " Maggot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ca n't you stop squeaking with it, and come over here. " " Just a moment, " he told her, his nose wrinkling. He thought he caught a whiff of the scent trolls put off when they wanted to mate. But he was n't sure, not even in this small room. His inability to recognize such smells or respond in kind had been a source of great embarrassment to him and amusement to the other trolls. Part of the gap that had sent him in search of human mates. " But Maggot. " She ambled over, stretching out her big hands to rub her rough fingertips gently over his skin. She picked something off his back - a loose scab - and put it in her mouth. She was grooming him! He shifted his weight away from her hands. She had taken the turkey for an interest gift - the signal from a male troll to a female he wished to mate. His fingers closed on the pulse of the crystal and pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewel you mean? " " No, " said Ehren. " But it 'll do. " He lifted his hands in front of him, making an odd gesture as he blurted out words in a language Maggot did n't understand. The heartbeat pulsed into hot life, burning Maggot 's fingers, and he started to fling it aside. Before it had gone an inch from his hand, it flared, shooting out a searing white light that burst in Maggot 's eyes, blinding him, lancing pain through his head-the last thing he glimpsed was Ehren frantically untying his feet. Holly screamed in terror. Maggot grabbed for Ehren 's legs and missed. " Catch him, Holly! " But she thrashed on the floor, shrieking. Rocks tumbled in the doorway as Ehren climbed over them. Maggot staggered to his feet, rubbing his eyes, trying to push the light out of them but it was hopeless. He fell sideways, reaching for the wall, climbed upright and felt his way toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you? " " It 's all right, Holly! " He shouted, even though there was no sound to shout above. " I 'm going out to catch him. " " No! " Something slammed into him, knocking him off his feet and away from the door. " Hey! " " You ca n't leave me, Maggot, " she yelled at him. " You ca n't leave! " " I have to, " he said, finding his feet. " I 'll be back. " " No! " Her hand smacked him again, and sent him sprawling all the way to the far wall. There was no use being silent. She could smell him, no matter where he was, despite the singed sharp scent to the air. " He 's getting away. " " Let it go away. We do n't need it. " Fury shook Maggot. He 'd been tricked, betrayed. He rolled toward Holly 's voice, as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What about me? " she cried. A stone flew across the room and hit the wall near Maggot with a loud and hollow thunk. Chips of stone flew through the air, striking Maggot and cutting his skin. The next stone clipped his shoulder, and he ducked, covering his head. " Holly! Stop it! " She roared and rushed past him into the anteroom. Scrapes and clatters and large slabs of stone slamming into each other sounded in the doorway. Even unblinded, he would n't have dared to go through the doorway. " What are you doing, Holly? Stop! Let 's talk! " " You are not leaving. I am not going to be alone again. " " Holly- " " I 'm not! " Her voice was muffled by the mound she 'd built. The big stones slammed into place, one after another, with a grave finality. He was walled up inside the pyramid. Far away, through the stone, he heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. 10. MAGGOT LEANED against the piles of stones. After several hours, he expected his eyes to adjust to the darkness but he still could n't see a thing. His head throbbed, sore as ever. " It feels like it 's almost time for sundeath, " he said. " The shadows are getting long, " Holly responded from the other side. " But not quite yet. " Every time he 'd tried shifting the rocks, she 'd started screaming at him to stop, adding more slabs of stone to the other side. " You are n't going to leave me in here all night, are you? " he asked. " We 'll look for food together. " " No, " she said wearily. " You 'll just chase after that animal again. " " I promise I wo n't. He 's gone over the mountains by now. " " Maybe, maybe not. I 'll sniff out his path to be sure. Then I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and paced in the dark. Three steps forward, two to the right to find the pile of feathers and bones left over from the bird. Four steps forward, seven to the left to find the bow and sword and other tools. Two steps beyond that were the stones she 'd thrown at him in her first panic. His feet knew and avoided most of the debris scattered on the floor. " It 's too small out here, " she said, meaning the anteroom. " I 'm squeezed. I 've had to see the daylight at the end of the cave all day long. " Her voice was terrified. He retraced his steps. " I 'm sorry, Holly. This is a much better room in here. No sun at all. Open it up again. " " No. Maybe at nightend. Depends on what I find. " Maggot sat down. " You 're going to try to run away, " ' she said. He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said. Her statement was followed by another loud crack as she ripped away another section of the stone veneer and smashed it onto the pile covering the door. He breathed deeply, measuring his strength. It would have to be sufficient. " Has night come yet? " he asked after another pause. It was her turn to be silent. After a while, she said, " Yes. I 'm going out now. Stay here until I come back. " " I 'm not going anywhere, " he said. He pressed his ear to the stone, listening for her to leave. Carefully, he reached up to the top of the pile. It was thinnest there, and he thought he could quickly clear a space big enough to crawl through. He very gently removed one piece of rubble, setting it softly down on the ground. A second piece followed it, and a third. The fourth stone he removed opened a crack as wide as his finger. A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Air blew through a nose. " Stop that! " Holly commanded. She drummed out the danger beat upon her breast. " I do n't want to stay in here, " he answered. There came a sound of smashing and cracking, with more stones piled up against the narrow doorway. He wondered if there was any wall left out there at all. " You can quit, " he called out. " You can quit! " She slapped more stones onto the pile. " I 'll stay here all night if I have to. " " No, " Maggot hollered back. " Just go sniff out the man 's trail. Make sure he 's gone. " " Do n't tell me what to do! " He measured out the steps of his little prison once again, three steps, two steps, over to the gobble-bird, trying to think of something he could say to change Holly 's mind. There was still meat on the wings, and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later. It helped ease his thirst some as well. Two steps, three steps back to where he started. Counting and remembering was an old troll habit, ingrained in him by his mother from earliest childhood so that he would never lose his way in the caverns underground. Just like he had done in those caves, he began to explore, memorizing every crack in the wall and pebble on the floor. When he came around the stones that Holly had hurled at him, he found the chipped block in the wall. He was tracing the outline of the scratch when he felt the block move under his fingers. " La la la, la, " Holly said on the other side of the stone. " Go on! " Maggot shouted. " I 'll wait for you! " He was already pushing on the block, pulling with his fingernails, until it came loose. He jumped back as it fell so it would n't land on his feet. He cringed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antechamber. But there was nothing. Slowly he put his hand into the vacant. space, expecting to find another stone behind the first. Instead, he found emptiness. He thrust his arm into the opening as far as his shoulder, reaching around. There was another hollow behind this wall, just as there had been behind the wall outside. The mortar that held the stones together turned to grainy dust as he shoved the blocks back and forth, pulling one after another from their perches and setting them quietly on the floor. It became easier as he went, the stones sliding out with less and less effort until a whole group of them fell in a cascade of rock. He was sure Holly heard it, and he waited for the rush of stones being pulled away from the door as she charged in to stop him. But nothing happened. Thrusting the fallen stones aside, he squeezed through the short, narrow opening and found a narrow space between walls. His fingertips searched carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pyramid. The stone had the unmistakable wear associated with weathering, as though an older structure had been enclosed within a new one, now grown old as well. He retrieved the sword and bow and arrows Ehren had left behind. The older building behind the false wall had a different shape than the pyramid that covered it. The space between was filled in behind by gravel, but not completely, or else the stone had settled. Pushing the quiver and scabbard ahead of him, Maggot wormed his way over the loose gravel. Carvings at the corner of the old structure left room for him to slip down a level, then another. It almost seemed as if the builders had been intent on preserving the carved men that guarded the older building. With each level he left behind a little skin. Black surrounded him, a night as dark as the comforting night that trolls looked for when they died. He felt his way ahead, fingers stretching into the darkness. Slight movements of air, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level. He shoved his weapons ahead of him, into a space a little more than.a foot wide. Stretched out at an angle, pressed tight between a slab of stone and the compacted rubble, he took a deep breath and pushed ahead. He could n't move. He tried to ease back and could n't budge that way either. He was trapped. The faintest wind stirred on his face, and a whistle, distant but clear, came from the same direction. His chest could not expand enough to draw another breath. When he released part of the breath he held, however, he found he could move a bit. He kicked, pushing stones back with his toes, with his knees. Finally he could twist the one hand stuck at his side. He thrust stones through his legs, until the arm came free. Then the other slid back to join it, and he was pawing like a dog digging a hole. Or a grave. Because if there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. An inch at a time, he wiggled ahead, shoving the quiver in front of him with his forehead, until it dropped away and he saw light coming through a hole as long as his arm, no bigger around than his fist. He shoved the bow and the sword after it, and then he attempted to swim through stone, shoving rubble through his legs and kicking it into the emptiness behind him. The hole grew larger. He gulped in breaths of fresh air, listened to a clicking sound from outside, and watched dust motes dance in the sunlight. At last he pushed his head through, and his shoulders. He was at the base of the pyramid, where the windblown tree had upturned the foundation stones. With a cry of agony he twisted free, pulling himself through the last hole and into a grotto formed by cracked and upturned slabs of stone. Too long blinded by darkness, he was now blinded by light. He lifted his arm to shield his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away. When he bent to gather his weapons he saw the source. A skunk stood beside her nest, hidden in the tumble-down rocks, stamping her feet and hissing at him. Her tail was raised straight up in the air. " Please, " he said quietly, " do n't spray - " At the sound of his voice, she jumped, emitting a jet of mist straight at him. He grabbed his weapons and tried to leap over her, but he stumbled. She sprayed again. He covered his stinging eyes, and squeezed through the gap between the roots and rocks. He stumbled over the vine-covered stones, across the dead tree, and out into the broad, empty plaza occupied only by daylight. A lone carrion bird circled above, a black slash wheeling in the blue sky. Beneath it, on the edge of the long pool, Maggot spied a lump on the ground. He went to its side, saw what it was, and knelt beside it. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from crotch to collarbone by Big Stinky. Maggot stood up, fists clenched for a reason he did n't understand. He started to walk away, then spun and kicked the body. He kicked it again and again, so viciously it nearly separated the parts. His breath came hard through his nose. The jewel rested a short distance away. Maggot picked it up - it was cold to the touch, as lifeless as the corpse. He carried it over and threw it in the pool, watching it sink into the bottomless muck and disappear. Then, with a second glance at the carrion bird, he dragged Ehren 's body over to the edge and did the same, waiting until it also sank. Holly would have to be in hiding. Maggot bounded up the steps to tell her what had happened. His fists were still clenched-it was her fault, she was the one who made Ehren afraid, made him run. Halfway up the pyramid, Maggot faltered. He could see Holly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chunk of stone in her hand. Her head was turning, eyes lifted up to the west. She 'd torn down so much of her hiding place to block in Maggot that the sun had caught her just before it set. Turned her to stone. His fists fell open. " Oh, Holly, " Maggot said softly. He stood there, as still as she was. Then he went back and snatched up the weapons. Stupid man. Stupid troll. He did n't need men or trolls. He was covered by a layer of dust, filling the smaller scratches that overlay the deeper cuts from the panther. He smelled like a skunk. He needed a bath, a place to rest. That was all. The path to the rim of the valley passed half in sunlight, half beneath the shadow of the trees. All he could think of, as he went, was how happy he 'd been to laugh with Ehren, and how good it had been to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth. Without realizing it, Maggot turned toward the lands where men and trolls lived, and lengthened his stride until he was running along the piebald trail.
