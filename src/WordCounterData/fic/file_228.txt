4162741 And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. Chrysostom had been a novice for six months when he started to itch. On his back most of all, but later, on the nape of the neck, his armpits, and finally the belly and his face as well. He did not ascribe to it much importance at first. It was August, the air was full of pollen and the yard was full of straw, hay carts were making endless circuits around the fortress, the nettles at the edge of the moat were up to the eyes ; by day simply millions offliescrawled on the walls of the pig-fattening farm below the orchard. Flies blackened even the Porta Speciosa 's carved plaitwork and consoles of red marble ; saucer-sized gadflies buzzed around Eather Cripple 's mules, and when the Sun set, dense clouds of mosquitoes swarmed in a haze over the cistern. Plenty of reason for itching, then, to say nothing of the gatekeeper 's black mongrel, which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cholesterin 's cats, must have spread fleas around the yard from where, in the hems of the monks ' habits as they swept the ground, they quickly reached the farthest corners of the monastery, even unto the smallest personal shrine. No sign of itching was apparent, that is, no dropsied swelling to suggest a botfly, nor the bumpy, flushed remnant of a mosquito bite, nor any minute reddish needle prick to indicate that a flea had busied itself, despite which Brother Chrysostom, a native of the village belonging to the monastery, scratched peacefully the whole summer long, not worried about a thing. It grew cooler in the autumn, and in the fog mosquitoes, gnats, house flies disappeared -- and even the fleas on the gatekeeper 's dog preferred retreat to adventures in search of monks, deacons, and novices to taste. But good Chrysostom itched persistently, if anything worse than he had done in August. That was when he first began to worry. He had checked he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mange ; no jigger had burrowed into his skin. He was concerned the itching might be a vestige of his temporal life -- God forbid! -- and if so he would be obliged to confess, no matter what scorn he might face. For that reason, he furtively but thoroughly scouted the others at Vespers, Sunday Mass, Compline, Vigil, and kept his eyes peeled when others scratched, noting how much and where. When the early frosts came in late November and the leaves fell, and insect life ceased, and at night the quack of restless ducks echoed off the ivied walls, while by day rosaries of cranes, gently snaking, flew low above the chapel tower, Chrysostom saw that the others were also scratching. The server Prius, Papyrus, and Father Bungle, as much as the gatekeeper 's dog or Cholesterin 's cats. Even Abbot Gigas at the elevation of the Host, and more than once ; in one hand, the consecrated white wafer, the body of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment of transubstantiation, involuntarily scratched beneath his cassock. " If everyone scratches at the same time, then there is nothing wrong with anyone. Why worry? " went through his mind, though Chrysostom did not rule out that his morbid self-observation was a product of vanity. When one day he realized he was praying for his itching to cease, he was ashamed for his lack of trust in God 's will. If it was God 's will that he itch, then he would have to scratch, but on no account would he supplicate for relief during Vespers. How could he, when village beggars, and lepers on the outskirts of town, were praying for a crust of bread, pleading for their very survival? If Chrysostom turned to his Father in Heaven for relief, would it not be better to say prayers for relief of Abbot Gigas 's itching? It was due precisely to this conscientiousness that Chrysostom could not free himself of his problem. When at last Chrysostom did confess. Abbot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and refused to grant him absolution. The poor novice agonized over what the Lord 's intent could be if he were expelled for confessing an itch. The next day, the abbot summoned Chrysostom with the idea of reprimanding him. Chrysostom 's own idea was that the abbot would expel him from the monastery. Abbot Gigas was strict, but his decisions were painstaking, and while his brethren were inclined to discipline the novice, the abbot asked him what his purpose had been in confessing to an itch. Chrysostom replied : " Father Abbot, since the itching had lasted a long time and not gone away, I thought that if the Lord was visiting this problem on me. He might want me to tolerate it. In the end, I saw that it was a test for me as a celibate, and if I am scratching it is because I am resisting His test. " Abbot Gigas was surprised, bid Chrysostom take a seat, and began wondering if a more fitting place for so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in the ranks of a learned order. He was minded to suggest it but quickly recognized that the Little Brothers might take offense, and the abbot -- a natural diplomat -- cultivated good relations with Capuchins as well as Dominicans, Benedictines, and even hard-nosed Jesuits. What, though, he thought, if the Lord has sent this novice to me as a pious example? God 's purposes are inscrutable. This novice may be right : one ought not to scratch in holy places. Well, let the good man remain with us until it is clear what use can be made of him, or to what end Heaven blessed him with such zeal. So he explained to Chrysostom that it was permissible to scratch ; there was no Scriptural passage forbidding it. Then, granting him absolution, the abbot dismissed the novice, who felt relieved, though his misgivings were not wholly allayed. When Chrysostom 's mother was allowed afive-minutevisit during Christmas celebrations, he asked her first how his siblings were, then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter part of winter, the monastery was quieter than usual, the days being spent in meditation, though for Chrysostom there was no respite : seated or standing, he itched intolerably. One evening, on opening his Vulgate at Genesis, the first book of Moses, he noticed a minute, creamcolored bug hurrying from chapter i, verse i8, in the direction of 3:15. He leafed rapidly through the book and found more bugs of a similar kind at 37:20, Judges 16:6, Matthew 23:27 -- and, at Revelation 20:1, no fewer than three. Despairing, Chrysostom closed the Bible, crossed himself, took the sheet from his cot, and, although it was forbidden, hung it out the window, shook it, then laid it on the table and smoothed it out. Bending over it, he tousled his hair in search of bugs. He repeated the process a dozen times until, on his sheet, he found a maggot. " Lord God! I have lice, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour or not, made his way to the misericord and burst in on the abbot. " What has happened. Brother? " Abbot Gigas asked, given that Chrysostom was drenched in sweat, scratching wildly, and clearly desperate. " Father Abbot, I have lice, " the novice directly answered, hands clasped as in prayer, eyes lowered, standing next to the wall. The abbot reflected, then brought him out of the room. " Stay here, " Abbot Gigas said, then made his way to Father Iodide, who meticulously examined Chrysostom 's hair, neck, and even armpits but found nothing. The abbot shook his head, evidently annoyed. " What makes you think you have lice? Not that itching again? " Chrysostom protested, quietly and respectfully, but firmly : " No, not the itching. I really have found lice. There are few left on me, Father Abbot, but the Vulgate is crawling with them. " " Your copy of the Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Iodide smiled but, catching the abbot 's look of disregard, his brow too darkened. " So, your copy of Scriptures, in Revelation? You had best bring us that Bible. " " Of course, " said Chrysostom, rebuttoned his habit, adjusted the scapular, and rushed to his cell. " Let 's go inside, " Abbot Gigas suggested to Father Iodide, who was counting, in Chrysostom 's absence, on discussing in confidence how this novice, odd in the best of times, had now taken leave ofhis senses. Abbot Gigas, however, said nothing ; he sat patiently at his desk, while Father Iodide stood by a painting of the Virgin near the half-shut door. They did not have to wait long ; the novice returned, breathless, his Bible grasped between a finger and thumb. Abbot Gigas made room on his desk. " Set it down here. " Chrysostom obeyed. " Open it at Revelation. " Chrysostom opened the book but, before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right Reverend Abbot, they vanish into the binding in a flash. " " Yes, yes. Just open it. " At which point, Chrysostom opened his Bible at a louse-infested passage indicated by a bookmark, while simultaneously Abbot Gigas and Father Iodide leaned forward curiously. Four or five cream-colored, louse-like bugs scurried around. Chrysostom, relieved and smiling, straightened up and said nothing but was proud of himself. Father Iodide inspected the pages, squashed one of the slower creatures with a thumb, and turned to him : " But these are only booklice. Brother. They do n't suck blood. The library is crawling with them. There is no cause for alarm. " Chrysostom asked what booklice ate and was told that they feed on bindings, dust, anything at all that can be found in old books. He was comforted but also crestfallen as he made way to the door, when the abbot called out : " Just a moment. Brother Chrysostom. It would be well, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more often and spend less of your time focused on itching. " It was then that it occurred ' to Chrysostom that he might have done better joining the Franciscans than a learned order. But, in hne with Abbot Gigas 's counsel, he began to inspect his Bible before every canonical hour, skimming from page to page in search of booklice. The itching worsened, but he tried to ignore it and refrain from scratching. He perfected his toleration of itching to the point that he alone in the monastery never scratched, though resistance made him perspire. He spoke no more about the matter, lest he be examined again, and did not tell Abbot Gigas of the bumps that appeared after his ordination. These were around his navel, in a place that no one would see. Then a few, hardly bigger than mustard seeds, cropped up on his back as well. Chrysostom kept an eye on them, but they spread no further, nor did they change, and since the yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swallowwort is effective for warts and corns, he tried treating his bumps the same way, but it had no effect. In midsummer, one of them did start to grow and in less than a week had swollen to the size of an apricot pit. The blister was soft, yellow in the center, and it hurt. Chrysostom struggled for a few days, then one evening lanced it and squeezed out the thick pus ; the blister subsided, the pain diminished, and the lesion started visibly to heal. By early spring, though, everything took a turn for the worse. The bumps began to spread at an extraordinarily rapid pace ; they spared his face for a time, meanwhile growing like boils on his legs, back, and stomach -- the same painful, purulent blisters, the size of apricot pits, as before. It was hard work to pierce them, press out the pus, then hide his pain and despair. Collecting his strength, he chanted the Lord 's praises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herb garden, scrubbed the crypt, made sure the chapel lamps did not run out of oil. Eventually, the nodules appeared on his neck and face ; they seemed like a rash. Abbot Gigas admonished him to wash his face more frequently, so Chrysostom washed his face and entire body six or seven times a day, given the chance and if no one was looking. He carried lavender from the herb garden and scattered it under his bed of boards, hoping that the vapors would have a salutary effect. There was no obvious result, and he was troubled by the thought that what he did was tantamount to stealing. " Father, I have sinned, " he said at confession. " I repent of it from the bottom of my heart, but I have stolen. " Father Bungle, the confessor on duty, was shocked : could it be that Chrysostom, whom he knew to be an earnest and industrious soul, was stealing from the other brothers or even the cloister? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred Our Fathers and a hundred Hail Marys, and required as well that Chrysostom lead at Lauds for a month and confess to stealing in the presence of the abbot. Chrysostom, of course, would more willingly have fasted for thirty days or led Lauds for a year than appear before the abbot again, but he reported in due course, as ordered. " What does this concern. Brother? " Abbot Gigas asked. " If only I could say that the garden hose was blocked and the sage had shriveled, anything at all except ' I have stolen '! " ran through Chrysostom 's mind. Taking a deep breath, however, he fell to his knees and, in genuine humility and contrition, confessed : " Father Abbot, I have stolen. " That was all. Abbot Gigas was unfazed, did not jump to his feet. Ouietly and coolly, he asked : " What did you steal? " " Lavender from the herb garden. " " You did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Varadic 's permission? " " I did know. " " Did you apply.to Brother Varadic? " " No, Father Abbot, I did not. " " Well, then, it really was stealing, " Abbot Gigas decided. He pondered a while, then, seeming disturbed, he asked : " So tell me, what on... what did you need the lavender for? " " For my complaint. " " You are not going to tell me. Brother, that it was for the itching, " the abbot unhappily sighed. " Father Abbot, no! For my boils! " Chrysostom replied. " My sores! I have no idea what they are -- they just grow on me! " Abbot Gigas looked at him quizzically, so Chrysostom lifted his habit to allow his shins, teeming with blisters, covered in blood and pus, to be seen. " God in heaven! " the abbot breathed : " Drop it! Drop it! Go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Chrysostom stood by the well in the cloister, dejected but trusting, and inspected the familiar gargoyles and depictions of the deadly sins as if he were seeing them for the first time. The sky over the courtyard was blue as the Virgin 's veil, and a fresh breeze whispered down from the clouds ; a great white bird was circling in the center of the square space, as if in a fresco. Chrysostom wondered what it could be. A stork? No, storks were not so white. A heron? A pelican? A giant gull? A white eagle? Albino crow? White vulture? An angel? At that moment. Abbot Gigas arrived with Father Iodide. The abbot acknowledged Chrysostom 's patience, then said : " Now, Brother, strip. " With occasional glances up at the sky and at the raven-angel or angel-eagle. he readily set to undoing his habit in the spring breeze and glittering sunshine, in front of his brothers in Christ. " Lord, have rnercy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes over Chrysostom 's naked body. Then he whispered something in the abbot 's ear. " Well now. Brother, " Abbot Gigas turned to Chrysostom, who was wanly smiling. " This seems to be a case of the punishment coming before the crime. We do not know what the matter is with you. " That news did not distress Chrysostom. He stood mother naked in front of Abbot Gigas and Father Iodide, in the fresh and fragrant atmosphere beneath God 's free blue sky, no longer hiding his ugly lesions but displaying them, owning them, so to speak. He felt he had been released from a great burden, as someone who confesses his faith and his sins may feel. The feeling took such firm hold on him that he was not at first troubled even when the abbot said : " As we do not know what the matter is, we can not allow you to go back among your brothers. " Chrysostom noticed that the angel was swooping lower and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave the house until you have healed or else it is ascertained what the matter is, " the learned Father Iodide said. The import of their words sank in slowly. Chrysostom looked at the abbot in astonishment and imploringly at Father Iodide before prostrating himself. " Not that! Fathers! Right Reverend Abbot! Do not remove me from this holy place. " Abbot Gigas and Father Iodide commiserated as Chrysostom repeated, " Our Father, which art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name.... " " Maybe there 's not much wrong with him, " Father Iodide whispered. " It would be wrong to expose the brothers to such a risk, " the abbot countered. The two withdrew to discuss the situation and summoned the other monks. Chrysostom was instructed not to move from the quadrangle. He stood in place the entire afternoon. Evening drew close. The air cooled a bit, the stars came out and, with them. Abbot Gigas with Fathers Varadic, Iodide, and Bungle. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a look grimmer than usual, from which Chrysostom knew at once that the abbot would not speak. Father Bungle spoke in his place : " My dear son, we truly pity that this must b your fate, and we do understand, but what you must understand is that we can not take the risk that your sores might spread to the other brothers. Two choices are open to you. You must either leave the house and return only when you are healed, which would be best both for you and for us and may even be most nearly God 's will too. Alternatively, having seen your devotion and having no wish to add grief to your afflictions and pain, we can offer you the opportunity to remain here on condition that you are isolated from everyone else. " Full of hope and curiosity, Chrysostom listened to Father Bungle, who, after a pause in which he looked at Abbot Gigas, and Abbot Gigas nodded slightly, continued : " As you know, our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is the one place where you could be separate from the others and yet, to a degree, remain with us. The well is very deep ; you would be completely on your own, and there would be no way of knowing how long you would have to stay before you could come up. Think it over ; take your time. " Chrysostom responded with tears of joy and would have liked to leap over to kiss the abbot 's hand, but both the abbot and the other monks shrank back. " That is not possible, my son, " Father Iodide said. " Non possumus " Father Varadic added. " The well, then? " the abbot asked Chrysostom. " Yes, Right Reverend Abbot. God bless you! " " Indeed. Then wait here while Father Bungle gets your things together and brings a chain for us to lower you. " " So soon? " Chrysostom asked. " Are you having second thoughts? " " No. I ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bungle whispered something to the abbot, whereupon the latter turned once more to Chrysostom : " Well, then. Father Bungle will stay with you tonight, keep vigil with you and pray with you for you to recover. At Matins we will open the Porta Speciosa so you can hear the brothers praying for you and for the good health of the monastery, after which you will have to be lowered. " His voice choking with gratitude, Chrysostom inquired : " As for my theft? " The abbot pondered : " You have done penance enough ; I absolve you. Be watchful. Make good use of this night. " The night was mild. Chrysostom was curled up on his habit, bare, but did not feel in the least cold. Around midnight Father Bungle, who since eight o'clock had recited hymns with him, said : " My son, we can do no more. Say your bedtime prayers and have a rest. Heed the reverend abbot 's advice : make good use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's bountiful heaven. That is what I am going to do. " Without a further word, Chrysostom stretched out on his cowl. For the first time, he felt no itch. He lay there until dawn, not scratching, gazing at the stars, the clouds, the first blush of daybreak. When the Porta Speciosa was opened and Father Bungle gestured, Chrysostom pulled on his garments and got to his feet. He waited for the Dei Gloria, then sang so lustily that those inside could hear him, and when Matins came to an end he knelt down at the edge ofthe well. Not long after. Father Bungle returned with a length of chain, attached it to the windlass, and tugged hard on it several times. " Ready to go. Brother. We will send down all the things you will need as soon as you reach the bottom. " Chrysostom took another look at the sky. " God be with you, " Father Bungle intoned. " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost cheerfully, stepping onto the lip of the well, grasping the chain, and beginning to lower himself. Scrambling downward, his habit riding up to his waist, hanging onto the chain as it scraped the inside ofhis thighs, chafing his sores, Chrysostom was afraid as never before in his life, but he resolved to proceed and not cry. He was greatly relieved to reach bottom, though it was not so dry as he had been led to expect. The ice-cold water reached his knees, and there were several bones in it. He felt like shouting for them to pull him out, but looking up, dismayed, he could not get a sound out of his throat. The fear of the descent was sheer bliss compared with what took possession of him below when he saw the tiny bright disk that was to be the sky from that moment on, and at the edge of the sky the shadow of Father Bungle 's far-off silhouette. Chrysostom felt tinier than the tiniest booklouse, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you all right. Brother Chrysostom? " came the bleak, distant, cavernous voice of what, above, was Father Bungle 's warm and friendly, intimate voice. Chrysostom 's lips pressed together, then burst apart ; his mouth opened colossally, and he yelled. But not a sound escaped. All that escaped was a frightful darkness, like a batflyingout of a church tower. Chrysostom 's face was wet with tears, but he had not a word of complaint. He wriggled and gaped like a carp in a landing net ; hope instantly evaporated. " Halloo there. Brother Chrysostom! Are you all right? Answer me! " the distant voice boomed, and since Chrysostom was unable to answer. Father Bungle headed to the refectory, where the brothers were preparing for breakfast. Abbot Gigas rattled off grace, made a sign to Fathers Iodide and Loggia, then set off with them toward the cloister. By the time they reached the brim of the well, Chrysostom was feeling better, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-third psalm with fervor. The three fathers leaned anxiously over the well, from which they could hear, rising softly from the darkness. The Lord is my shepherd ; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures : He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul : He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name 's sake. Father Bungle held his head. Father Loggia said : " Let 's pull him up! " Abbot Gigas shouted down : " Chrysostom, answer! " What was heard from below was Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil : for Thou art with me ; Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me. Abbot Gigas went for Father Bungle : " How could you send a man down without a light? Bring lamps immediately! " Father Bungle disappeared. Before long a light was dangling beside Chrysostom, who still was chanting psalms -- the warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chrysostom clutched it to his body and looked up as if the Lord himself had answered his prayer. He saw three shadows at the edge of the well, and at last he heard the calls. " Chrysostom, Chrysostom! Can you hear me? " " Ye-e-es! " he yelled heartily back. The rest of the day was given over, with some disruption to the monastery 's usual order, to equipping Chrysostom 's new home. As shouting was ineffective in the echoing well, the monks brought from the deacons ' room a board, out of which Father Nimbus sawed an attractive piece that was sent down, along with a dozen sticks of chalk, for Chrysostom to write down what he had need of. So the ' poor brother would not have to stand directly in the water, they lowered planks, dowels, nails, and canvas, also a little table, a chair, bed linen, a mirror, a razor, a vat to wash in, anything that Chrysostom wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the well went on until evening. When there was nothing left to send that Chrysostom had asked for, and the monks could see a tiny figure waving cheerily up at them from the dim light far below and heard him shouting up, " I 'm fine. Brothers! Go about your own business, " they gradually dispersed. Father Bungle, worn out from the previous night 's vigil, the uncertainty and then the panic that ensued after Chrysostom was sent down, had to be helped back from the cloister. He was despondent, suffering qualms of conscience. Though Abbot Gigas had said, " We too should have remembered a lamp. We sinned as well, " the words offered Bungle little solace. To avoid further unpleasantness, the abbot organized a well watch, with Father Cripple in attendance that first night. From then on, things went more smoothly. Chrysostom had no complaints. Wishing not to be a burden on his brothers, he prayed a good deal, mostly psalms, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. At cockcrow, when the churchwarden hurried to the chapel to set out sheet music on the benches and light candles in the cloister, he would stop at the well and call down : " Daybreak! Rise and shine! " Chrysostom, unseen, would rise immediately, tidy himself, and wait. He was surprised to find that, after a few weeks, he could hear even slight noises and sometimes could pick out fragments of Gregorian chant wafting across from the chapel, so he knew the point the monks had reached in their devotions on the surface. It naturally took time for the precise allocation of roles to become clear : which brother was to haul up Chrysostom 's waste, who would send clean water down, who would burn his clothes outside the walls. Father Varadic compounded ointments with which the entire community, from the gatekeeper to the abbot, hoped Chrysostom would be healed. Abbot Gigas was surprised by the number of little errands the brother on duty at the well came to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone to fulfill these duties without complaint. Down below, meanwhile, Chrysostom was freezing. The bottom of the well was dark and dank and also cold. Snow in the monastery 's reservoir, piled up in winter, would often linger until May, so we may imagine how much colder it was in the well at twice the depth. The bottom of the reservoir could be seen even when empty ; the bottom of the well, never. Chrysostom looked on shivering as a part of his penance, but when the growing cold got so bad that he could not sleep for a week, vomited, had visions, and was tormented by a mortal fear of dying, he thought, " My sin is not so great the Lord would have me freeze! " and asked his brothers to send downfirewood.The trouble was, the smoke did not rise, or not right away, by which time it was billowing at the bottom of the well and Chrysostom was in danger of choking. At that point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given the task of heating bricks in Father Cholesterin 's enormous oven and lowering them down to his ailing brother. When the rains came, Chrysostom requested that a roof be built over the well, and by morning of the next day Father Nimbus had knocked together an attractive gambrel roof -- but when Chrysostom realized that he now could not see even the coin-sized spot of sky he had been able to see before, he implored them to dismantle the roof : he would rather take shelter in a recess in the wall when it rained. The sickly monk put up with many inconveniences ofthat sort and truly did make an effort not to be troublesome, but his brothers took the extra work he made for them as part and parcel of life in the monastery. In just one thing were Chrysostom 's wants without limit : confession. Confession and Communion were two responsibilities that Father Bungle, who still felt guilty about the lamps, voluntarily assumed, but he had no idea what he was taking on. Chrysostom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and of course the latter could be done only in the context of a Mass. No handy chalkboard would suffice, but to do it orally took a painfully long time. Father Bungle would yell down, " The Lord be with you-ou-ou-ou. " Chrysostom would wait for the echo to die down before bellowing back up as loudly as he could, " And with thy spiri-i-i-it. " Or Father Bungle would yell, " Lift up our hearts unto the Lo-or-or-ord. " To which Chrysostom would roar back hoarsely : " We lift up our hearts unto the Lo-or-or-ord. " At certain points, the ritual would so wear Father Bungle down, not just his throat but his spirit, that he would introduce a short intermission( or " pause for meditation, " as he called it) and flop down beside the well. In these intervals, as a way of, as it were, signaling he was still there in spirit, Chrysostom would bawl up : " Blessed be the name of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his doubts about whether this procedure comported with the sanctity of the Mass. After due deliberation, and with reference to the fact that Chrysostom was himself an ordained priest, the abbot gave him permission to say Mass for himself, down below, and moreover to take Eucharist. Father Bungle passed on that news to Chrysostom as a glad tiding for the monastery and for his own life ; now Father Bungle was obliged only to " hear " Chrysostom 's confessions. The situation really did improve. Chrysostom took great care in preparing for rituals in the well ; he was given an old chasuble of Father Iodide 's, the whole day long he sang the Lord 's praises, he said Mass, and when he considered himself of a pure heart, he took Communion. There, however, was the catch. Although he lived a life ever purer, more innocent and concentrated in purpose, he regarded himself as ever more sinful. It was not uncommon for him to receive absolution, then ask immediately to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who increasingly took his place could see Chrysostom ; they were not able to see in his eyes the sincere, childish desire to seek immaculacy, perfection ; they did not in the dank semidarkness see the lunatic gleam in his eyes as drops of water off the lip of the well hit his brow ; they did not feel, like Chrysostom, that all hope, faith, passion, and purity, all meaning, suffering, the pain and happiness of existence, were concentrated on the rim of a well that shone above, where final absolution awaited. Whatever was hauled up from the well -- cold bricks, waste, leftover scraps from a meal -- the chalkboard would be there too, and on it " I have to confess. " And the sins he confessed to! He confessed regret, first, that he liked the taste of his food and that he was happy after taking Communion. Later he confessed to thinking he might be a holy man. Father Cholesterin kept his vow of silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right track with Chrysostom, so on occasion the abbot would take his confession, and he would profess his sins in exceptional detail. After a long period of quiet, Chrysostom again became a topic for whispers in the refectory. In the end, the brothers came to the view that it was sinful and dangerous to condemn the unfortunate pious soul to such idleness. " Chrysostom is bored, " Father Nimbus advised the abbot. " He has nothing to do. We should set him a task. " Abbot Gigas agreed ; the only question was what task to set for someone covered in sores, with a festering and shivering body. sick and by now possibly half-mad, who had spent three years crouching at the very bottom of a pitch-black, dank, and icy well nearly eighty feet underground. Chrysostom 's name was repeatedly included in the litany of the next Sunday 's High Mass, and the abbot did not shrink from admitting to his fellow monks that, even after consultation with other superiors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a fitting occupation for Chrysostom. " I pray the Lord may shine a light on someone, and someone will dream up something, for the sake of our sick brother. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, Amen. " Thus Abbot Gigas concluded the Mass. Not long after, a letter sealed with the reverend abbot 's seal was lowered into the monastery well : Brother Chrysostom, Together with the Eathers, I have pondered recently on the purpose of your afflictions. Eor one thing is certain, that the Lord does nothing without a purpose. I must admit that we have been remiss in not, as we ought to have done, giving thought earlier to what message the good Lord is sending us through you. I shall be brief It is our sacred duty, besides work and prayer, to meditate, and most particularly on the nature of God and the world that He created. I think that, in busying ourselves with routine affairs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty. Perhaps the Lord sent you to us, and placed you in this situation, so that you should do what we have omitted to do. No one has so much opportunity for meditation as you do. One might perhaps say that you were sent here to remedy the omissions of an entire cloister. So help us, I implore you! I ask in my own name but also on behalf of all the brethren, indeed our entire order. We have begun to organize instruction and spiritual exercisesfor the novices and deacons. We would like you to share with us the wisdom and thoughts that you have acquired during your own prolonged meditation and in the course of prayers and vigils, so that we may learn from them, young and old alike. You should feel free to formulate theological tracts, to express any thesis you may have in connection with Church doctrine. I urge you to give this thought and send word. Ab. Gigas Laudetur Iesus Christus! In a fervent reply, Chrysostom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and himself to make up for all the hours of meditation that had been missed, so it was not long before much paper, ink, and a fair few books were being lowered to him. It took some weeks for his craving for confession to subside, but there was no question that the tactic worked, and Chrysostom did not feel more sinful on that account. He may well have been happy for the first time in his life. Every morning, the churchwarden would bellow down, " Daybreak! Rise and shine! " Twice per day, the novices would let down piping-hot bricks ; and disposing of his dirty clothes and waste became a once-daily routine. Father Varadic compounded ointments for his skin complaint, which were lowered in an enormous jar once per month, on the first Sunday. The procedures were so routine and smooth, now, that Chrysostom was virtually forgotten. The monks knew, of course, that the piping-hot bricks, the food, the drink, the ever larger quantities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the countless candles, oil for the lamps, books, clothes, and holy water were being lowered to a brother monk, but these seemed like offerings made in pagan cults. Abbot Gigas looked through thefirstof Chrysostom 's writings and saw that their theological value was zero and their language primitive, but the abbot did. not have the heart to crush him and, after all, his writings had fulfilled their set purpose. They had achieved what was intended. To all appearances, Chrysostom was living a more balanced life, causing fewer worries, and was warming to his assignment. Whether it was slops, an empty jar, a bucket, or a wineskin, whatever he sent up would come with a carefully rolled-up scroll, his latest manuscript. Not that anyone read them. Abbot Gigas thought it would be a sin to burn them, and it was he who had invited Chrysostom to write, so the manuscripts were sprinkled withflowersof sulfur and placed on a rack in a smokehouse, so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On a sunny morning in spring, the priest on well duty was Father Bungle, who was now often ill but still keen to be of service. He pulled up the bucket, and as the day was as bright and fine as the one long before when Chrysostom had been lowered into the well, the thought crossed Father Bungle 's mind that he had not for a long while been summoned to take Chrysostom 's confession ; indeed, he could not think when he had last even heard news of him. Which set him to wondering, too, why the younger priests competed with such ardor to take Chrysostom 's confessions. It occurred to him that Chrysostom no longer confessed at all, and so the task of taking his confession meant a guaranteed rest period in midday ; perhaps the young priests did not even bother going to the well anymore. When he had worked out this theory. Father Bungle hastened to see Abbot Gigas. First and foremost, he drew attention to the culpable negligence of monks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondly, if something was awry down in the well. The abbot thanked Father Bungle for his vigilance and was ashamed to admit, as the monastery 's superior, that he had noticed nothing unusual. The next day, after lunch, the abbot and Father Bungle went to the well. Abbot Gigas shouted down : " Can you hear me. Brother Chrysostom? " There was no answer. " Chrysostom! Hell-o-o-o! " Eventually, the monk shouted back : " Reverend Abbot? " " Brother-er-er! When did you confess las-as-as-ast? " After a long interval, during which Abbot Gigas and Father Bungle looked at each other, the reply returned : " I do not know-ow-ow-ow! " That evening, Chrysostom received a letter from the abbot, in which he was asked why he neglected penitence, when that was as much or more a part of meditation as exegesis of Holy Scripture, comparing the synoptic Gospels, or contemplating proofs of God 's existence. Could it be, the reverend abbot asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confess? Chrysostom did not understand why he had received such a letter when he wrote down his thoughts at least daily, on the subject of confession among other things, and sent them up to the surface. True, it had been a while since he had written specifically about the sacrament of penance ; evidently the reverend abbot had forgotten what he had said. But if the abbot wanted his confession, he would confess. The abbot reappeared at the well. " Chrysostom! Hell-o-o-o! " " What-t-t is i-i-t. Father Abbot-t-t? " " Do you not want to confe-e-e-ess? " " Ofcourseldo-o-o-o! " The abbot fastened his little basket to the chain and lowered it. " Send up the list of your si-i-i-ins! " The basket had hardly touched the bottom when a yank on the chain indicated that he could haul Chrysostom 's sins up. What Abbot Gigas read, to his great distress, was the words, " One thing troubles me greatly. Father Abbot, and that is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes. He read the sentence again, but it made no difference ; there was no ambiguity. He looked down into the well, as if checking it really was Chrysostom who had scribbled this. But who else? So he wrote in response : " You are well aware that for this I can not give you absolution. " He thought a moment, wadded up the sheet of paper into a ball, and pitched it into the well. He leaned forward to listen, then after a long wait a shout replied : " I know-ow-ow-ow. " Following this scandalous incident, indignant, ashamed, flushed, perplexed, angry -- with very mixed emotions -- Abbot Gigas stomped back and forth until Father Bungle found him by the entrance to the library. " Where are Chrysostom 's most recent writings? " Father Bungle mumbled in alarm : " I gave them. Father Abbot, to Brother Cripple. " The abbot stormed through the library, the narthex of the chapel and the nave, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bursting in, without knocking, on Father Cripple, who sprang to his feet from his kneeling position in front of a personal shrine. " Where are Chrysostom 's most recent writings? " " Brother Typhus puts them in the sacristy. Father Abbot. " At that. Abbot Gigas cut back along the route that he had come, from the dormitory, through the cloister, and, after a hasty genuflection, through the chapel, before rushing into the sacristy, where the churchwarden was in the process of folding the freshly laundered altar cloths. The abbot letflyat him : " Where are Chrysostom 's most recent writings? " " Usually here. Father Abbot, under the pyx. " Abbot Gigas searched furiously among the missals, hymnals, breviaries, and formularies but did not find them. He looked inquisitively at the churchwarden, who spread his arms : " If a lot pile up, they are taken to the smokehouse. " The abbot returned to the chapel, then, after another genuflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crypt before stealing out from the side aisle opposite into the connecting corridor and from there into the library. He steamed past an astonished Father Bungle at such a pace that his scapular fluttered, then rushed out onto the sun-baked bastion, down the well-worn little staircases, under the shaded great circle of the fortress 's maple trees, straight for the pig-fattening farm, with the smokehouse as his goal. Inside were hanging hams and sausages from three pigs and smoke billowing out the door. The abbot asked the hired help sweeping the yard where Father Cholesterin was, to which the lad answered by pointing to the far side of the pig farm : " Only just before, he went that way. " Hitching up his cassock, the abbot sprinted over the pools of blood and found Father Cholesterin in the outhouse behind the pig farm. He rapped on the door : " Cholesterin, are you in there? " " Yes, Father Abbot, " Father Cholesterin groaned. " Hurry! " Abbot Gigas ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " How can I fish Chrysostom 's writings out of the smokehouse? " Father Cholesterin began his answer with the imperturbable calm that distinguished him : " When the hams and sausages... " " Right now, immediately! How can they befishedout now " " I 'll send in the lad, " Father Cholesterin said, then explained to him what to look for and where, tied a scarf over his face, and pushed him through the door. Almost choking from the smoke, the lad staggered out a few minutes later. Abbot Gigas snatched the big bundle of papers out of his hands and was just about to set off when the hired hand said : " There 's more. " " Bring the lot out! " After the fourth ti-ip. Father Cholesterin got hold of a handcart, had it pulled around in front of the building, called over Father Varadic, who just then was heading for the orchard, and they lugged it all up to the abbot 's room. Abbot Gigas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Father Iodide went upstairs to check that nothing was wrong. The abbot was sitting by his desk, studying the pile of smoky manuscripts. All he would say was, " Take Mass in my place. " The abbot was left to himself by a surprised Father Iodide. Although he did put in an appearance at Vespers the next day. Abbot Gigas suddenly left in the middle, and at supper he nodded off For the next few weeks he rarely attended Mass, looked sleepy, peaky, and taciturn. If he asked after anyone, it was always, as if randomly, " Is Chrysostom all right? " When he quizzed candidates for ordination, he asked if they had read Chrysostom 's writings. Then he banned novices and deacons from going into the cloister, and even the churchwarden was forbidden from calling down into the well. The monks grew concerned and discussed whether they should send word to His Grace the Archbishop that not all was well with the Right Reverend Abbot. What had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smokehouse differed so radically from Chrysostom 's initially pious efforts as to raise the question whether it was no longer Chrysostom writing them down below. Most were carefully composed memoranda, written in a refined, effortless, almost perfect Latin style ; they would have done credit to the cleverest and most learned of theologians. Equally, however, each disclosed the most outrageous line of thought. How was it possible for a man to shift, over a relatively brief time, from artless piety to writing essays in occultism, spiritualism, telekinesis? How could Chrysostom have come up with a title like ACADEME &; SMACKHEADEME? Heresy, blasphemy, and worse -- the writings of the previous two years did not concern ecclesiastical affairs or fellow monks or events in the life of the monastery at all. True, Chrysostom had been in no position for some time to know anything about such things. But his papers were not about life outside the monastery either. Whatever life Chrysostom had lived before taking holy orders, it was hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writings concerned flying men, large-breasted women, midgets, talking mummies, singing dogs, humans coupling with swans, self-propelled carts, frogs swimming in the sky, argumentative leeches, rebellious earthworms, walking trees, and other monstrosities. The abbot did not know whether to seek an exorcist or an inquisitor. In the end, he sealed Chrysostom 's fate by writing a brief letter to the Jesuits and entrusting Brother Ficus with its delivery. Meanwhile, Chrysostom, when he was not writing, paid a great deal of attention to the brim of the well, keeping an eye on the sparrows. The sighing of trees, the patter of raindrops, and the dripping of eaves in early springtime were only present to him in the form of memories, despite which he led a busy social life in the well. He conversed, contended, and caroused with many individuals not there in reality but most certainly there in Chrysostom 's imagination. A damper was thrown on the party mood when the abbot banned delivery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbed by Chrysostom without a murmur, from which fact the abbot concluded that Chrysostom was not consecrating the wine for Eucharist but drinking it for his own pleasure, and in ever greater quantity. Three inquisitors were already on their way when a basket a good deal fuller than usual descended into the well. As much lamp oil, hams and fruit, shoes and clothes, as could be crammed in was lowered into the well, along with wine and a letter : The news is that the Swedes are coming. Pillaging! We have no way of knowing what will happen. These are " iron rations. " Keep your wits about you tonight. I am going to send down a few more things. If there is any trouble, pull them down yourself. If anything should happen to us, try to climb out of the well with the ropes and crampons you have been sent. Er. Bungle Laudetur! As promised, another five basketfuls arrived, which included among other things Chrysostom 's writings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the monastery. So that night Chrysostom ate hisfilland got thoroughly drunk. He supposed that, if anything was going to happen, it would not be that first day. He was wrong. Hardly had day broken when he heard skirmishing up on the surface, with a smashing of panes of glass, a moaning of monks, the greetings of Swedes, and a thundering of hoofs on the graniteflagstonesof the cloister. Not that anyone could see anything at the bottom of his well, but he thought it would be best to stack his paraphernalia in the niche, in case a torch was dropped into the well and everything went up inflames.Chrysostom himself laid low in the recess with an occasional glance upward in search of news. He was beginning to plan how to climb out and wbat he would do up above when he heard a dull thud alongside him in the well. He looked up to see if someone was standing by the rim, then lit the hurricane lantern. Lying at his side was Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. During the years that Chrysostom had spent in the well, he had grown accustomed to the idea he was not going to heal. that his condition was deteriorating bit by bit ; the self-disgust he had felt initially also faded away. It seemed perfectly natural to him now that he had lost the toes on his left foot, and he did not send these up but kept them -- or, to be more preeise, the bones -- in the well 's recess. He had grown accustomed to writing with his left hand, because the bones of his right wrist were sticking out of his skin. He no longer smelled his own stench and was no longer bothered even by the pus seeping continually from his body. After a time, he no longer felt there was so great a difference between himself and others as there had seemed at first to be. But Father Iodide, dropped with a thud beside him -- even with his body shattered and his throat slit -- looked marvelous by the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands intact, his hair cropped short and silky, his brow radiant, his thighs strong, his chest ample, even with a broken spear sticking out of it. Chrysostom was transfixed to the spot by the sight. He could see Father Iodide 's graceful, long fingers wrapped around a dimly gleaming rosary, and by the same light he could see his own hand holding the lantern. Hand? Half of it had withered away, the other half was now a putrid ugly lump running with pus. Still, Chrysostom did not understand that he himself was almost a corpse, halfway to decomposing, when, following Father Iodide, Father Cholesterin and Abbot Gigas fell down the well in quick succession. Chrysostom had no longer had any memory of the abbot 's features, which were fully intact, his corpse having dropped head over heels onto Cholesterin 's plump body and his face having missed the walls of the well on the way down. The abbot 's face had retained the same dignified, forgiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chrysostom had confessed stealing from the herb garden. He saw again the classic profile of that handsome, magnificent, clever, and diplomatic man. His body gone, Chrysostom 's identity, so laboriously constructed, began also to break down, as if it were being shoved downward. Next to plunge was the body of Father Bungle, then, after some shouting, a young novice unknown to him thudded onto Abbot Gigas 's chest as if he lay his blond head there in hope of refuge. By the time the carnage had ended and the bodies of monks blockaded Chrysostom into the recess of the well where he had resided for sixteen years, he had truly seen the light. It made no sense for him to climb up and out. There was no pardon for his loathsomeness, his apostasy ; for his existence there was no liniment, salve, or balm. Taking a long pull on the wine sack, he climbed onto the cadavers of his brethren and stretched out flat on his back. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely so much as blinked. He watched the round, ever brighter patch that for him was the sky, the world, God. Around noon the Sun appeared overhead. For the first time, it shone vertically down into the well. Chrysostom fancied he could see the lip covered in blood, and dangling from it rags -- perhaps cowls hacked to bits? He could see the underside of the lip, the distant fans of ferns growing on the inner walls. By then the Sun seemed to lean still farther over the well, until it was precisely at its middle and lit right down to its very bottom. For sixteen years, the Sun had never once reached Chrysostom. Now the well 's walls were incandescent, orange along their entire length, as if alive, a gigantic gullet. Chrysostom could see the water trickling down its side, could see a nacreous haze hovering at the well 's last cylinder, and he could not get over it that the Sun was stationary. The well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could be seen leaving the lip, cautiously, quietly, and with a barely audible whisking it sank with a murmur into the well, as if a guardian hand allowed a giant wafer to be lowered toward Chrysostom until he realized he was no longer in the well, though where he had got to, almost miraculously, with the help of the descending Sun, there was no way to tell.
