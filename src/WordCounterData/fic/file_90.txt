1013341 Plum Sykes 's new novel, The Debutante Divorcee, explores the singularly decadent lifestyle of New York 's latest It girls : the newly unwed. <p> Can you believe John Currin and Rachel Feinstein have come... as themselves! " said Lauren the night of her birthday party. " They 're so existential. " <p> The first time I saw Lauren Blount after we met in Careyes( I was on honeymoon, and she was on Divorce Honeymoon, as she liked to call it) was at her thirty-second birthday in her West Eleventh Street town house. It 's that crisp, double-width, white-and-brick Greek revival affair between West Fourth and Waverly Place. Like all Lauren 's birthday parties, this one was a costume party. The theme was Legendary Lovers, and Lauren said it did n't matter whether the couple you went as were still together or broken up, alive or dead, because she said no one could remember that sort of detail about those sort of people anyway. Guests could come as Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes if they wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dita Von Teese if they felt like going completely over the top. <p> Standing at the doorway of the first-floor drawing room, Lauren was wearing minuscule hot pants of primrose-yellow terry toweling and a candy-pink tee. On her head was a blonde wig tied in perky pigtails. Her feet were clad in glowing white bobby socks and brand-new white leather roller skates. To all intents and purposes she was Rollergirl ; the one thing that made her very not Rollergirl was the diamond Cartier bracelet fastened to her left wrist. It glittered alluringly in the light cast from the temporary disco ball twirling in the center of the room. <p> " It was the Duchess of Windsor 's, " said Lauren. " Is n't it heaven? Uncle Freddie sent it down "( " Uncle Freddie " being the name Lauren used for the totally unrelated Fred Leighton, of Madison Avenue jewelry fame). <p> " It 's so beautiful, " I remarked. <p> " I was thinking of dressing as Bianca Jagger tonight, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out every night dressed as Bianca Jagger already. So I 'm Rollergirl, which has nothing to do with anything except it guarantees me maximum attention. Does it look like a roller rink in here? " <p> " Not exactly, " I said. <p> With its walls upholstered in antique pink satin, the Cedric Gibbons furniture inherited from one of Lauren 's movie-starlet grandmothers, and the Rothkos and Rauschenbergs, Lauren 's drawing room feels like an avant-garde boudoir. It 's usually immaculate, but tonight the room was strewn with couples dressed in witty takes on the party 's theme. Two gorgeous teenage boys, leaning nonchalantly on the front balcony overlooking the street, were dressed as Jean Harlow and Marilyn Monroe, in platinum-blonde wigs and crystal-studded gowns. Over by the fireplace, right underneath a huge Gilbert and George collage, stood two cool girls in gray suits and glasses, dressed as the artists. There were Bogies and Bacalls lounging on black lacquer and gilt chairs, and a very convincing Jean Shrimpton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Penelope Tree and Truman Capote duo sat cross-legged on the floor talking intensely, while a Halston and Warhol combo stepped coolly over them. On Lauren 's sofas, which had been recovered in old 1930s Japanese kimono fabric, three sets of Johns and Yokos sat gossiping as hard as though they really were John and Yoko. People seemed to be having fun, which, I have to say, was something of a surprise : In New York, a glamorous party full of gorgeous people usually resembles a death march. <p> " Gingertini? " asked a waiter, offering us a tray of electric-orange drinks. Like all the other male staff that night, he was dressed as Donald Trump in a tuxedo, hairpiece, and fantasy tan. The waitresses were multiples of Melania, their hair teased into skyscraping brunette beehives, their bodies squeezed into wedding dresses so tight they threatened to suffocate them. The real Melania is a miracle of human survival. By this point in her marriage she should have suffered death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you adore my Donalds? " said Lauren, taking a gingertini from the tray. " He and Melania are the ultimate tabloid couple. " <p> Just then, Hunter appeared. He kissed me on the cheek and then held out his hand to shake Lauren 's. Lauren took it, gasping, melodramatically, " Hunter! The divine new husband. I am so thrilled to meet you. " She flung her arms around Hunter and gave him a huge hug. " God, you 're so handsome. I ca n't stand it! " <p> Hunter extricated himself from her embrace. I could see he was amused. <p> " The divine new friend, I assume, " he said, kissing Lauren on the cheek. <p> " Oh, wow, you 're so charming I want to faint. God, Sylvie, you must be so, like, thrilled. " <p> I smiled. Lauren seemed genuinely happy for us. She drew back as if to observe us. <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she cooed. Having just been in Mexico, it had n't been hard to rustle up my scarlet Frida Kahlo flamenco dress. Meanwhile Hunter was in paint-spattered overalls that he 'd created himself. " You must come downstairs and meet Milton, my interior decorator. He 's going to die over both of you. " <p> With that, Lauren wove her way through her guests, leading us through the crowd, blowing kisses as she went. When we reached the stairs, Lauren removed her roller skates and skipped down ahead of us. On the parlor floor, Lauren put her roller skates back on and then we headed toward the back of the house into Lauren 's " morning room. Well, that 's what Milton calls it. I call it the White Room. I mean, I 'm not Marie Antoinette... yet. Milton 's so pretentious, " she moaned. " But I adore him all the same. I mean this floor he made me do, " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " Parquet de Versailles. It 's real. Can you imagine? Daylight robbery. " <p> We arrived at two mirrored French doors on the parlor floor, and Lauren pushed them open into the " shoes-off " white room.( All-white rooms are so in right now in New York that you 're barely able to keep your shoes on at night at all anymore. That night, though, everyone was allowed to keep their footwear on, thankfully.) Even though the room was packed, I could see six pairs of white-painted plaster palms along the back wall, separated by six sets of French windows that opened onto a formal planted garden that had been floodlit for the night. It was more like Venice than West Village. At one end of the room was a very rock-'n ' -roll white baby grand piano, watched over by a Tom Sachs White collage. The floor was pure white marble, and in case you do n't know much about marble snobbery, the plain white kind without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's very now, to pay more for less-or rather, to pay a lot more for a lot less. <p> " There he is, " said Lauren, gesturing at a woman perched on the end of one of two deeply tufted white silk chaise longues. Milton Whitney Holmes( real name : Joe Straaba) was dressed as Iman in an homage to the former owner of the house. His vintage Alaia dress and Afro wig looked bizarre on him, since he 's rather petite and white, so he 'd hung a name tag from the dress which read mrs. david bowie, in case no one recognized him.( They did n't.) Milton was chatting to a slight girl dressed in a prim-looking tweed skirt and Fair Isle sweater. Her main accessory was a tube of pale-pink lip gloss that she squirted at her mouth every five seconds. <p> " Drat, Marci Klugerson 's got to him, " sighed Lauren as we approached. She turned and stopped us for a second. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice to Marci. She seems perfectly innocent, but she 's a terrible gossip-she hears everything, and always gets it slightly wrong. " <p> Milton waved from the sofa. When we got over there, Lauren introduced everyone before disappearing into the throng. <p> " Marci, I think maybe we were at Brown together, " I said. <p> Marci looked at me curiously for a moment and then said, " Sylvia... Wentworth? " <p> " Yes, " I laughed. " Well, it 's Sylvie Mortimer now ; I 'm married to Hunter. " <p> " Congratulations, " said Milton. " You make a cute couple. " <p> " I hear you 're absolutely best friends with Lauren, " said Marci, glaring at me. Suddenly she looked troubled as she added, " Well, actually she says you 're her second-best best friend. I 'm her best best friend. Officially. " <p> " Darling, I 'm Lauren 's best friend, " declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met Lauren, in Careyes, " I said, sensing an atmosphere. " I barely know her. " <p> " I know. Lauren told me all about you. She says you 're the most wonderful influence on her, " said Marci, slightly grudgingly. <p> Suddenly Marci seemed nervous. She scanned the room, tugging awkwardly at her tweed skirt. <p> " I 'm so unoriginal, are n't I? The only thing I could be was Bridget Jones Two because I 'm so enormous. And do n't tell me I 'm thin because I know I look like a museum. But at least my husband looks like Mark Darcy-well, Mark Darcy with red hair. Ha-ha-ha! " <p> " Darling, I 've just spotted an old acquaintance over there, " said Hunter. " I 'm just going to pop over and say hello, all right? " <p> " Sure, sweetie, " I said as Hunter headed over toward a group in the far corner. <p> Milton patted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down. <p> " How 's married life? " asked Milton. <p> " It 's so nice- " I started, but Marci interrupted me. <p> " Being married has got to be the dragiest drag of all time, " she groaned. " My self-esteem will never get over it. I love and adore Christopher and everything, but marriage is totally hideous. The only girls I know getting any sex are divorced. " <p> I must have looked surprised because the next minute Milton was nodding his head and saying, " Absolutely true. " <p> " Milton, " said Marci, " I heard Lauren 's converted the wine cellar into a fur vault. Apparently it 's colder than Alaska down there. Or is that just a rumor? " <p> " I could n't possibly divulge my clients ' secrets, " said Milton, suddenly sphinxlike. <p> There was an awkward pause and Marci went bright pink. " I did n't mean to pry- " <p> " Now, what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupted, looking at me and changing the subject. <p> " He's- " <p> I looked around and finally spotted Hunter standing over by the piano with his back to me. He was chatting to two girls dressed as white-faced Harajuku twins. One of them was very plain, the other noticeably beautiful, with such extraordinary cheekbones it was hard not to stare. The ordinary one soon moved off, and I could see Hunter still chatting to the cheekbones. The girl 's face was framed by a gleaming wig of straight Japanese hair. She was wearing a white shirt, a black tie, and a mini-kilt. Her legs were of the insanely long, rangy variety indigenous to summertime Sardinia. On her feet were extremely high platform shoes and knee-high white socks. She looked weirdly chic actually, especially with Lauren 's all-white room as a backdrop. <p> " There he is, " I said, pointing Hunter out. " Let 's go over and get him. " <p> We all got up. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, she stopped and stared. <p> " Un-be-lieve-able! " uttered Marci. She sounded incensed. " He 's with Sophie D'Arlan. Look at her! Touching his arm like that, " she whispered as we all crossed the room toward them. " She 's an outrageous flirt. I do n't like to gossip, at all, you know, but apparently Sophie is always having an affair with several people she should n't be. You 'd better watch out for her. " <p> " Marci, we got married four weeks ago. I do n't think she 'll go after a newlywed, " I said, unconcerned. <p> " Do n't think the fact that you 're married is going to stop Sophie. She only dates husbands. " <p> " Stop scaring Sylvie, " retorted Milton, hobbling behind us on his high heels. " I 'll see you later. I 've just spotted the real David Bowie. " <p> With that, Milton wobbled off toward the garden. Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kissed Sophie in a friendly way. <p> " Sophie, do you know Sylvie? " said Marci, turning toward me. <p> " I do n't think I do. Hi. I 'm Sophi-a D'Arlan, " she said, extending her hand. She spoke with the trace of a rather exotic French accent. <p> " Sylvie 's married to Hunter, " added Marci. <p> At this news, Sophia put her hand out toward the piano, as though to steady herself. <p> " You got... married? Hunter? " said Sophia, looking at him accusingly. <p> " They 're wearing matching wedding rings, Sophie, " said Marci pointedly. <p> " It 's Sophi-a, " she said. Then, with a loud sigh of disappointment, she added, " Anyway, congratulations, Sylvie. I 've known your gorgeous new husband, God... forever, since high school. We were like that, " she said, crossing her index and forefinger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I ca n't believe you did n't tell me you were taking yourself off the market! " She stared at Hunter for a little too long, eventually turning to me and saying, " Hunter is being so nice. He 's helping me with something I 'm working on. So sweet. " <p> " He is sweet, is n't he? " I said, smiling at Hunter. I felt him loop his arm around my waist and squeeze me affectionately. <p> " Yes, he 's a very attentive husband, " said Marci, quite obviously directing this at Sophia. <p> " Hey, girls, enough of that, " said Hunter, looking embarrassed. <p> " Would you be sweet, Sylvie, and just let me steal Hunter for another five minutes, to discuss my project? " said Sophia. <p> Without waiting for an answer, she steered Hunter off toward the fireplace. Marci looked after them, her expression sulky. Just then Lauren reappeared, skating expertly across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palm of her left hand. <p> " Tequila shot, anyone? " she asked, setting the tray down on a little side table. Marci took one and downed it in a single gulp. <p> " Where 's Hunter? " said Lauren, looking around. " I want to get to know him better. " <p> " Over there with Sophia D'Arlan, " I said, gesturing toward the fireplace, where Sophia was still talking with Hunter, with a serious look on her face. " Apparently they 're old friends. " <p> Lauren pirouetted expertly on her roller skates and then bent double and touched her toes. From this position she said, " Sophia says that about everyone 's husband. " <p> " Hunter 's helping her with some project she 's working on, " I said. <p> " Believe me, Sophia D'Arlan does n't need anyone 's help. She 's better connected than Verizon. Her mom 's a de Rothschild or something, and her dad won the Nobel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " <p> " Oh, " I said. " Well, Hunter 's just nice like that. He 's good to everyone. " <p> Lauren stood up and surveyed the crowd. <p> " Even if my husband was a saint I would n't let Sophia near him, " said Lauren. <p> Before she could tell me anything else, the deejay struck up " Good Times. " I must have been dancing for almost an hour when out of the corner of my eye I saw Sophia kissing Hunter on both cheeks, French style, I guess. Then she threw both her arms around his neck and hugged him before making her way off. Hunter immediately headed over to us, weaving his way past a glamorous couple dressed as Liz Taylor and Richard Burton who were dancing with two girls dressed in white Carolina Herrera wedding gowns. They were both blonde, barefoot, and holding bouquets of white roses. <p> " Here comes Hunter. Mind the Renee Zellwegers! " cried Lauren as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 've been missing all the fun. How was it over there? " <p> Hunter wrapped one arm around me and let the other fall over Lauren 's shoulders. <p> " Not very thrilling without you two, " said Hunter. " Shall we get a drink? I 'm parched. " <p> A few minutes later as we sipped at our Saketinis by the bar Hunter said, " Now, I had a great idea. How about I set Lauren up with my best friend? He 's my oldest college buddy. " <p> " Who? " I said. <p> " You have n't met him yet, darling. He 's out of town on business a lot. He 'd be perfect for Lauren. He 's incredibly smart, and definitely glamorous enough for you- " <p> " That 's really dolly of you, Hunter, " interrupted Lauren. " But I do n't do blind dates. I think they 're tacky. " <p> " We could all have dinner next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't do setups either. I only do anonymous hot sex, " she replied, deadpan. " But thanks. You 're very sweet, as your wife says. " <p> " I may have to take matters into my own hands, " sighed Hunter with a knowing smile. " You two would be a great match. " <p> " You sound like that guy on The Bachelorette, " wailed Lauren. " Gross! " <p> " I ca n't interest you in a glittering marriage, then? " said Hunter, refusing to let his enthusiasm be dampened. <p> " Now you sound like my grandmother. I ca n't think of anything worse than being glitteringly married. " Lauren suddenly looked embarrassed. " I mean, unless I was you two. Sorry. " Then, changing the subject, she said, " So, Hunter, Sylvie was saying you 're leaving for Paris this week. " <p> " Yup, I 'm off for a few weeks, actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my darling wife? " <p> " -did I hear someone saying they 're going to be in Paris? " <p> It was Sophia. She was suddenly standing there, looking straight at Hunter. " I 'm going to be there too. Maybe we can meet for a verveine? At the Costes? I get so lonely over there.... Anyway, I just came over to say goodbye to both of you. You make the most gorgeous couple. Of course, I 'm devastated for me. " <p> " Why are you leaving now? " asked Marci, who had joined our group. " There 's still a lot of party left here, you know. " <p> " I have a very busy night ahead, " said Sophia with a wink. She turned to go and then paused, looking back over her shoulder, saying " Hunter, I 'll call you in Paris. " <p> Lauren shot me a quick warning look. I looked at Hunter, but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her reputation, but my darling husband seemed to be completely incorruptible. Tabloid couple we were not. @ <p> Excerpted from The Debutante Divorcee by Plum Sykes. To be published by Miramax Books May 1, 2006. Copyright( c) 2006 Plum Sykes.
