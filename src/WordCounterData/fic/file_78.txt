1011841 MY BROTHER AND I LIVE on opposite coasts, so we send videos to each other. In his last one, he set his camcorder on top of the television and did n't tell his current girlfriend it was on. He meant to make a kind of soft porn farce for my amusement, but he ended up filming the break-up date instead. <p> The first scene is Dave humming " Like A Virgin " and fussing with the room, setting up the molded plastic chairs tete-a-tete mode in front of the camera, lowering the lights, all very disgusting, and he knows it. The doorbell rings. He looks up and gives this campy wink to the camera. <p> You can hear them murmuring in another room, the chairs are waiting in their romantic, empty way, and then they enter, with shot glasses of Dave 's favorite drink, ouzo. Dave offers Phaedra a seat. She is a flatchested actress/paralegal with a Cleopatra haircut, long nose, long legs. More glamorous than pretty. She slides her chair a little closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glances at the hidden camera, scooches his chair so we 've got a full frontal view of him. Then he sprawls out, faux relaxed, six foot two, big shoulders, narrow waist, thick brown hair in a ponytail. He went to film school. He lives in LA under the name of Dove, reads screenplays that never get produced, and makes good money for it. <p> The girlfriend 's jeweled sandal is flicking from her narrow foot. She does n't know she 's being watched, so she seems like the heroine. Her silicon-injected lips are pouting. She says, " Dove, I need more from you. " <p> He sips his ouzo. He sighs her name- " Phaedra. " There 's this pause that makes your teeth ache. " I warned you when we metI have a problem with commitment. But I 'm a good kisser. " He leans towards her. <p> She ignores his lips. " You 're thirty-four. Ca n't your limits be stretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love you. " <p> He eases back to the center of his chair. An embarrassing silence ensues. " I 'm a loser, Phaedra. I 'll understand if you go on without me. " <p> She sort of rushes to the bathroom. Dave stage whispers to the camera, " Does n't look like I 'll be doing the nasty tonight. " <p> When she gets back her eyes are watery, and she has a pale green tissue in her fist. There 's more silence between the plastic chairs. Then, she blows her nose and stands. She says, " You have never, ever made me dinner. All I 've gotten from you are these nauseating, tiny drinks. " She kind of chokes back some sobs. " And I want my key back! " <p> He looks over at the camera and rolls his eyes, like, Yikes! Not the old key line! <p> My husband Charlie gently dropped his eyelids when he watched that part. He thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie is a general practitioner, partners with my father. Once I saw him kneel in the waiting room to tie the shoe of a pregnant patient. <p> Whenever the video 's on, Charlie averts his eyes, mumbles, " Sick. " <p> All I can do is say, " You 're right, " press rewind and then play, again. <p> I send Dave videos of my daughter, Kali. It 's cinchy-I just set the camera up on a chair beside her and read while the video records the image of a four-year-old girl playing naked Barbie family. <p> At the end of my last video, I make a rare appearance. All you can see is my middle-a swatch of skinny thigh, my shortish maroon skirt, a wrinkled lime green T-shirt. <p> " I know I look like hell( I remember I put my hair behind my ears, but you ca n't see that because I cut my head off in the video). It 's because of this dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm on my knees picking up toys, when Kali sneaks up behind me, grabs my hair, pulls my head back, and plants a kiss on my lips. This kiss is so hard I can feel her teeth on my teeth.This kiss knocks me backwards. She stands over me, grabs my hands and says, ' Let 's dance. We 're in love. ' " <p> The videos are nine-tenths of our sibling relationship these days. This story is really about the final tenth, about a bet Dave and I made in June, and how it fell out on Labor Day weekend at our summerhouse. <p> In the summers, Dave puts his Audi TT in storage, picks up his 1967 VW bug in the Adirondacks, and becomes a vegan counselor at the summer camp we went to as kids. This camp is where he meets half of his girlfriends, the Patchouli types, the ones he breaks up with by email in the fall. He meets an actress in LA around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for camp. <p> On the phone in June, one week into summer camp, he tells me he has fallen for the arts and crafts counselor, a Minnesotan with Swedish ancestry, named Anna. The only phone at camp is in the office just off the main dining room. Behind him is the dull roar and clank of a hundred children competing for a limited number of metal serving bowls of macaroni and cheese. <p> Dave just talks louder. " Anna 's a sculptor and a musician! She plays the electric violin with an all girl band in St. Paul! It 's a performance art thing! They use her sculpture as a backdrop! " <p> " A little bit country, a little bit rock ' n roll, " This is sotto voce, so Kali wo n't wake from her nap. The moment she wakes, even before she opens her eyes, she will begin to moan, Mommy, I need you. " What 's her sculpture like? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't looked! It might be a turn-off! " <p> " What 's her band called? " Still whispering. <p> " Clitorama! " We both snicker. " She made me a ceramic butterfly pin! " We 're laughing now. " Stop it, Diane, do n't screw with romance. " <p> " Helga is n't going to last the summer, " I whisper. <p> " It 's Anna! Want to make a bet? " <p> " Okay, " I say. " I bet you do n't make it through Labor Day weekend. " <p> " What do I get if I win? " he says. <p> " You get Helga. What do I get if I win? " I ask. <p> " You leave Charlie and move in with me. " <p> There 's this little sizzle in my chest. " Are you serious? " I say. <p> Dave says, " Labor Day or bust! " <p> Labor Day weekend. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie, and I pull down the gravel drive to our summer-house. Underneath the spruce trees, beside Dave 's bug, is an old Chevy station wagon that looks like a giant fourth-grade girl has gotten hold of it. The kind of girl with tubby handwriting, who dots her " is " with smiley faces and flowers.This car is neon pink and covered from fender to roof in plastic butterflies and fairies. The wind blows up-the spruce branches wave, the hundreds of tiny plastic wings shiver. <p> I circle the car, arms crossed. " Unbelievable, " I say. But then I look over at Kali. She 's still caged in the Volvo, behind the thick door. Her arms are raised, palms up. She 's speechless. <p> We set her free. She climbs out and runs her fingers gently over the plastic wings. We tell her to come to the house when she 's done, leave her to worship in peace. <p> Charlie and I each take a bag and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family cottage is not actually on Eagle Lake, it 's on the narrow inlet at the bottom. It 's just an old fishing camp with peeling white paint and red trim, kitchen/living room with a smoky fireplace and a sleeping porch, a bedroom and bathroom in the basement below. Every year we have to scrub the slime off the stairs down to the water and cut back the blackberry prickers and trap the mice and kill the spiders. But it 's on the edge of the best lake in the world. The only other human thing on the lake is our summer camps, one for boys, one for girls, but by Labor Day, we have it all to ourselves. Because of the acid rain, every year the water becomes clearer ; the environmentalists say it 's like swimming in vinegar. <p> I pull open the ripped screen, then the swollen front door. I 'm immediately awash in the waterlogged smell of mice and mildew. Dave is n't upstairs, and it looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop the suitcase on the chenille bedspread. <p> I 'm unpacking our bags when Kali runs in and butts the small of my back with her hard head. " I love you too much, Mommy. " She starts yanking out warped dresser drawers and twirling lampshades. She gets down on her hands and knees and crawls under the bed. I say, " There 's spiders under there. " <p> " There 's a toy. " <p> " Okay, " I say, throwing Charlie 's shirts into one drawer, his rolled underwear and tube socks into the little one above. I turn for another pile, and there 's Kali, sitting on the rag rug. She wags a pink dildo at me, " Hi. My name is Na Na. " The dildo is shaped like an Indian Maiden with a large beaver between her legs. Kali hits a switch and the tongue on the beaver begins to vibrate. " Can I keep it? " Kali asks. <p> " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll be careful. " <p> " It 's Dave 's private toy, okay, honey? " <p> " I want it. " <p> " Kali, I 'm sorry, it 's not yours. " I reach for it. <p> She hugs the dildo to her chest. " Unfair! " <p> Kali begins to sob, and I have to call Charlie in. He holds her while I wrench the dildo out of her hand. " Dave 's up to his usual shenanigans, " Charlie says, shaking his head. He carries Kali outside, whispering soothingly in her ear. <p> I let the beaver tongue my palm for a bit, then shut her down. I get a paper bag, drop the dildo in, write " Dove " on it in purple crayon and leave it on the kitchen counter. I leave the house in search of Dave. <p> Beside the house, Kali and Charlie are crouched, studying a monarch caterpillar consuming milkweed. Charlie 's holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always clean and manicured. <p> I look up then, and what do we have here, a tree house under construction in the old beech tree twenty yards from the house. Dave and what must certainly be Helga are grinning down at us. Except for tool belts, both of them are naked. <p> The general impression is as follows : Dave, a redbrown color, extremely buff, his long equipment swaying nonchalantly. Beside him, Helga, gold and pink, blue eyes, blonde eyelashes, white blonde hair tied with a leather thong, nose peeling. She 's got blonde hair on her legs, but she 's shaved her beaver back to its newborn state. <p> I pretend to shade my eyes from the sun, but really I ca n't take the wattage. " You guys have been at summer camp too long. " <p> I look over at Charlie, his face raised in goddess worship. I roll my eyes, walk closer to the tree house. <p> " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're the one that did that to the car, are n't you? " I say. <p> " Just some paint, a glue gun and a trip to the dollar store, " she says modestly. <p> " So, how are you guys doing? " I say. " Be honest. " <p> Dave smirks. " Hanging in there. " <p> Helga glances at him with a worried smile. <p> Charlie 's still crouched in the scrub, staring. <p> By now, Kali has rushed over. She pulls her shirt off and begs to climb up. <p> " You 'll get splinters, " Charlie calls, he 's finally gotten himself in working order. " It 's not a tree house for kids. " <p> I lift her, Dave reaches down and pulls her up by the arms. <p> " Steady! " Charlie says. <p> Helga keeps a gentle hand on Kali 's bare back, while Kali leans over the railing. Helga has this big, goopy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pants pocket and lets fall a bouquet of plastic wings. <p> Helgas smile wilts. <p> " Kali! " I say, pretending horror. " What did you do? " <p> Helga pulls Dave 's faded, ripped T-shirt over her tool belt and swings down the ladder like a trapeze artist. Then Charlie and Helga busy themselves picking up all the little plastic bits amongst the ferns. <p> " Is the bet still on? " I stage whisper, but Dave just grins at me as he passes Kali down. <p> While Dave and Helga get dressed, I choose one of my childhood favorites from the bookshelf, Alive! and lay myself out on the hammock on the porch. Kali climbs in after me, using my legs as the setting for her ongoing Barbie drama. <p> Dave and Helga appear. Dave in cargo pants, a green T-shirt, and workboots, Helga in a little blue thrift store sundress with a daisy print. Cute. No bra. Dave says they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get cinnamon raisin bread. This is a ritual of ours. Kali asks if she can come, but Dave says there are no seat belts in the back of his VW, so before Kali pitches a fit, Charlie retrieves Kali from the hammock, says he 'll take her out in the row boat. <p> Helga and Dave keep bumping up against each other and giggling. <p> " Put her life jacket on, " I call irritably, although there is no way Charlie would ever forget. <p> Dave followed me to Cornell, a year behind.That was the early eighties, the age of androgyny-Boy George, Annie Lennox, Cyndi Lauper. Before going dancing, we 'd get dressed in my dorm room, put on layers of ripped things and several plastic earrings each, mousse our hair up, then spackle on the black eye make-up. <p> We called ourselves The Untouchables. We 'd go to discos, dance just close enough to give people an incest thrill. If anyone asked us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was better than drugs. <p> I was an English major, he was in the hotel school. He took the wine-tasting class. He took Maple Syrup Production. Then, no warning, he left. He moved to New York, waited tables, tried to act, then went to film school in LA ; and just when my father was despairing that Dave would always be a hobo, he began to make a lot of money. <p> Charlie was one of the chubby, doe-eyed guys in our dorm who had a crush on me. Everyone said he was a nice guy. <p> At our wedding reception, Dave and I sat on the stone wall next to the Unitarian church, watching Charlie dance with our mother. We were sharing a cigar. <p> Dave said, " If you want, we can still run. Six blocks, my bug 's parked at Mom and Dad 's. " <p> But I was feeling contented, nicotine in my veins. I said, " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Untrue, " Dave said. " I would n't care if I never saw him again, but at least we can rest assured he will do no harm. " <p> " Exactly, " I said. " Charlie is life insurance against harm. " <p> A year later we had Kali. <p> Charlie carries Kali in from the boat, already asleep. As he takes her down the stairs, still in her life preserver, she moans, Mommy. I flinch, but she sleeps on. In Alive! most of the soccer players are a couple of chocolate bars away from cannibalism. A discerning few will choose to die rather than take a bite of flesh. I hear the front door slam, and Dave comes out to the porch. " Hi, " he says, squashing his big self into the hammock, making it swing wildly. " She wants me to move to Minnesota. " <p> " Get your legs off me. " <p> " We were in the tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more space. And she said she understood. It seemed like we were getting somewhere, and then, like two minutes later-Hello? -she climbs on my lap and she 's trying to talk to me with about a quarter of an inch between us. She was so close I could n't even see both her eyes. It was like talking to a cyclops. " <p> " She has pretty blue eyes though. She looks like the Swiss Miss girl. " <p> " Yeah, except the Swiss Miss girl was skinny. Anna 's a little fat. " <p> " You 're crazy. " We 're giggling now. " Shh.You 'll wake Kali. " <p> " Speaking of which, I think you 've been hitting the laxatives too hard, Di.You still look like a thirteen-year-old boy with a tit problem. A very small tit problem. If you move to LA, you 'll have to insert a couple of plastic baggies in there. And you 've got the same rat hair growing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of waxing, electrolysis, tweezers? " <p> " Yank it, " I say. <p> Then we hear Helga, yodeling, " Dove? " <p> " In here, " Dave sighs. Helga bounces in and actually climbs onto the hammock, causing it to sag to the floor. Her legs are all tangled up with mine. I try to wrench free. " It ca n't take the weight, " I say, but they ignore me. <p> " I was just about to perform rat hair amputation on my sister, " Dave says. <p> " You do n't have any unsightly facial hairs, do you? " I say to Helga, still struggling to get my legs out. <p> " I do, you just ca n't see them because they 're blond. " She rubs her chin and it 's true, there 's downy white fur on it. <p> " The girlfriend and the sister bond over their beards, " Dave says. <p> " I 've seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helga says. <p> " Fuck you, Dave, " I say. <p> " What? " Dave says, knowing exactly what. <p> " Those are n't for public consumption. " <p> " I think it 's great that you 're so close, " Helga says. <p> " We 're not that close. I 'm just the only one who remembers his real name. " <p> " So, Diane, what do you do? Dove 's never mentioned it. " She 's trying. <p> " What do I do? " Every time she moves, you get a glimpse of her Barbie doll breasts through the big armholes in her sleeveless daisy dress. <p> " Are you a homemaker? " <p> " A homemaker? You mean like sweatpants and anti-depressants? " <p> " She 's a professional bitch, " Dave says. <p> " Dove! " Helga chirps. <p> Which wakes Kali up-Mommy, I need you! -which puts an end to our getting-to-know-you talk. <p> Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go swimming. <p> I say, " Take Kali, " so they do. I stand in the picture window facing the lake, drinking a too sweet New York state white wine, and watching Dave and Helga strip naked again. Kali watches them swim out, her back bowed, her toes digging into the sand. <p> Charlie comes over. " Look at this, " he says. He 's holding the raisin bread loaf. The sweet cinnamon road that wound through the bread has been eaten away. " Kali loves this bread, " Charlie says. " Diane, look at this. " He shows me the other two loaves, both hollow. " Do you really think your brother is responsible enough to be Kali 's godfather? " <p> " Charlie, let 's not get into this again. Dave 's great with kids, he 's a camp counselor. " <p> " Remember what he said, when we asked him to be Kali 's guardian. He said ' If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, so I can change my life. ' " <p> " He was joking. " <p> " Look at them, they just left Kali there on the shore. She could drown. He does n't pay any attention to her. It 's an inappropriate choice. " <p> " Dave is the person most like me in the world. " <p> " You 're not that much alike. " <p> " If I died, he 's the one who should take care of Kali. " <p> Charlie 's face spasms. " What about me? " <p> " I mean if we both died, Charlie. Of course. " <p> There 's silence. For some reason I think of those two empty chairs in Dave 's video. <p> " You should start the grill, " I say to Charlie, and he goes to hunt up the charcoal. <p> Dinner for me is mostly taken up with Kali, keeping her from spilling her milk, cutting her meat. I try to join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy-whenever I turn away to talk, she cups my chin in her hand and pulls it back to her, so I give up and try to listen to Dave, Helga, and Charlie over Kali 's conversation, which is about a golden dress she wants to buy me. <p> They 're getting all chummy and slugging their wine and cutting big pieces of steak and eating with gusto. Helga glances at me. I 've noticed she is always trying to make some kind of meaningful contact or figure me out or whatever. I stare back like a zombie until she ca n't take it anymore. She zeros in on Charlie and says, " So, what 's your love story? " <p> Charlie smiles, " Oh, gosh. " <p> " Was it love at first sight? " <p> " I just liked her. Right away. " <p> " He liked me because I was mean. I was always shocking him. I corrupted- " <p> " -Mommy, do n't talk. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Kali pulls my chin around to her. <p> Charlie says, " She 's honest. She does n't ice things over. But I fell in love with her on a day I saw her at the cafeteria. She was n't even eating, just reading, with an empty tray next to her. I often seemed to attract women with eating disorders. The kind who shovel in enormous bowls of salad, choose a chocolate layer cake, take a few bites, then pour salt over it so they wont be tempted. Diane was n't like that. I 've always had this feeling she could sustain herself on books and air. " <p> " Charlie 's the kind of guy that attracts weirdoes, " Dave says with his mouth full. <p> " Thanks, Dave, " Charlie and I both say together. <p> " He always ends up pushing a homeless guy 's wheelchair or taking the keys away from a drunk. He 's God 's designated driver, " Dave says. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately, was his openness. He 's more like a woman that way. " <p> " Why do women always think Dave is so feminine? " Charlie says. " I do n't get it. " <p> " Because he 's sensitive, " Helga says. <p> " No, " I say. " Because while Dave 's buying toilet paper, he 's also making a movie about this sexy guy named Dove who ca n't decide between Scott 's and Ultra Soft. he does that subject/ object thing that women do. " <p> " You mean he 's his very own sex object, " Charlie says. <p> " At least I 'm not your sex object, " Dave says. <p> Helga changes the subject, asks Charlie about a heat rash she has from time to time, then they start talking about Helga 's art. <p> I interrupt, " You must have slides. Why do n't you give vis a show? " <p> She seems pleased and agrees. <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes at me and mouths, Cheater. <p> After dinner, I put Kali 's pajamas on, Charlie hangs a white sheet over the fireplace, Dave digs out the projector, and Helga gets her slides together. Then, we all snuggle up on the spineless couch with more of the sweet wine. Helga seems bashful and happy. We turn the lights off. The projector hums, Helga fiddles, turning slides around. Kali wants to hold the clicker, but Helga wo n't let her, Kali 's about to throw a fit, she 's getting tired, but then the first slide comes on. <p> We all stare at the veiny pink and red ceramic butterfly. It 's perched on a fountain and spewing water from its lower thorax. <p> " That 's good, " Kali says. <p> We laugh. <p> Helga presses the button and there 's another pink and red butterfly with water pouring out of it. <p> Charlie says in his usual respectful, interested way, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I look over at Dave, his face half in shadow, half in light. He 's way beyond Yikes. <p> Helga 's ready to talk though. " Georgia O'Keefe is a point of departure. I feel that representing the vagina as a butterfly, something that moves, rather than the static image of the flower, is- " she searches for the word in the air with her hands- " kinetic. " <p> " So, the butterfly is urinating? " I say. <p> " Actually, the water represents female ejaculation. " <p> " What? " <p> " You guys know that women can ejaculate. I mean, there 's a documentary film about it. Charlie, you must have come across this in your practice. " <p> " No, I have n't. Frankly, I do n't see the mechanism for that. " <p> " What are they ejaculating? " I ask. <p> Kali is n't paying any attention to us. She stands with her nose up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her forehead, making the butterfly billow. <p> " My butterflies ejaculate tap water. " <p> " No, but- " <p> " -Let 's look at some more slides, " Dave interjects. <p> " Helga, can you do that? " I ask. <p> " Anna. " Her face prunes up like I 've finally insulted her. <p> " Sorry. Anna. " <p> " Diane- " Dave says. <p> " Yes, I can, " Helga says, all dignified. " There 's a catalogue called Sister Paradise that sells a video with instructions. Charlie, you should really know about this stuff, in case your patients ask questions. " <p> " Yikes, " I say. <p> Pretty soon after, Charlie, Kali, and I leave the happy couple to discuss art in private. <p> Charlie brushes Kali 's teeth while I stand in the doorway. <p> " Those butterflies sort of T-U-R-N-E-D M-E O-N, " he spells, while he earnestly scrubs Kali 's molars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger I do n't particularly want to know. Then I notice myself looking at him this way, and suddenly I 'm at a turning point. It 's not like heartbreak. It 's more like a slow leak that has finally run my heart dry. Or, maybe it 's always been empty, and because of the bet, I finally have the courage to see it. " Charlie, " I say, " we need to talk. " <p> He looks up, right away, the brush dripping tooth paste suds. " Did that offend you? " <p> " We 'll talk later. " <p> " About what? Just give me the general subject. " <p> " Tell us, Mommy. " <p> " The subject is passion. Lack thereof. " <p> " Passion? " Charlie and Kali say together. <p> " What 's passion, Mommy? " <p> " Passion is strong feelings, like excitement. " <p> " So, now you want excitement? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement, " Kali says. <p> Charlie throws the toothbrush into the sink. He walks into the bedroom, then back into the bathroom, then makes the round again. He 's got his thinking cap on. Kali and I watch him. <p> Charlie rubs his hands together. " Girls, I 've thought of something exciting. " <p> Kali says, " Okay. " <p> I say, " One exciting thing is not going to do it, Charlie. We really need to talk. " <p> Charlie grabs the flashlight and tells us to follow him out into the dark. <p> " Can we please just put Kali to bed? " <p> " Diane, I can do excitement. " <p> " Charlie, I 'm trying to tell you- " <p> " -Let 's go. " Charlie leads us out the back door and around the house. I can hear Dave and Helga murmuring to each other. It 's chilly. We walk up the driveway, and he opens the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you doing? " I say. <p> " We 're going for a joy ride. " <p> " We do n't have the key, " I say. <p> Charlie presents the pink pompom in the ignition. We put Kali between us, she 's bouncing up and down. She presses the button on the glove compartment and it pops open. She pulls out aTootsie Pop, red. " Can I have it? " I unwrap it for her. <p> Charlie whispers, " They 'll hear the engine. We 'll just roll out of the driveway. " Charlie pulls the lights. Nothing. He hands me the flashlight and I open the door and shine it behind us. Charlie shifts the car into neutral. We hear the quite crunch of gravel as we glide backwards down the incline of our driveway. He tries to turn the wheel to the left, to swing the car towards the road. " Steering wheel 's locked. " <p> I hear the squeak as Charlie pumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says. He turns the key, the car does not turn over. He tries the emergency brake. Nothing. <p> We are backing rapidly towards the lake, gaining speed. I 'm still hanging out the door, training the flashlight into the darkness. We go over a dip, and I bounce out of the car. <p> I hear Kali scream, " Mommy. " My shoulder hits a rock. The station wagon backs relatively smoothly over the springy moss and ferns, the open door flapping slightly. I am still holding the flashlight. I know Charlie and Kali must be watching me, but the front windshield is black, and I ca n't see them. I stand up. <p> The car is now just a few yards from the water. The driver side door opens. Charlie, with Kali in his arms, leaps. The butterfly mobile bumps down the five log steps, both doors flapping, and slides, butt first, into the water. It clunks suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wings on the roof glinting in the moonlight. <p> I stumble over to where Charlie crouches, gripping Kali. <p> " Are you okay? " I ask. <p> " We 're in big trouble, " Kali says, staring at the sunken car. <p> " We are. " I laugh. " This will clinch it, definitely. " <p> " You 're hysterical, " Charlie says. <p> " We have to tell Dave. " <p> " Diane, wait- " Charlie says, " Let 's just gather ourselves- " <p> But I 'm heading for the house. <p> I squint in the light, Charlie hiding behind me. Dave and Helga are sitting on the couch, in what I immediately see is the break-up position. Each with their arms crossed, about two feet from each other, looking ahead. I am the icing to the cake. <p> " I thought you guys were asleep, " Dave says. <p> " There 's a slight problem with the butterfly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Helga sits up and takes notice. <p> " The engine would n't turn over. " Doctor 's diagnosis. <p> " We towed it here, " Helga explains. " It 's going to a children 's museum. " <p> I pick some twigs out of my hair. " I do n't think so. " <p> Helga jumps up, ready to save her baby. " What do you mean, what happened? " <p> " It fell in the lake, " I say. <p> " What? But. It 's a show car, we 're donating it to a museum. " <p> Charlie is literally hanging his head in shame. " I 'm so sorry, Anna. I take full responsibility. It was my idea. But, tomorrow, we can- " <p> Anna looks at Dave, who, you will have noticed, has said nothing. He shrugs. She rushes out the door. <p> I grin at Dave, give him the V for victory sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed. " <p> We all look at Kali, her face smeared with red lollipop, twigs and dirt sticking to her cheek, like some child who has already been killed. <p> I scissor my eyes at Dave.You want self-riotous, I 'll give you self-riotous, I think. I say, " Dave, that 's something I wanted to talk to you about. Charlie and I have decided to put Mom and Dad in the will as guardians. I just do n't think you 're responsible enough to care for a child. " <p> He just looks at me. <p> Kali says, " What child? " <p> Charlie pulls Kali 's face into his shoulder. He heads down to the basement bedroom. Kali begins to wail, " I want my Mommy. " <p> Dave and I are alone. <p> " You could take her for vacation, to Disney World, " I say to Dave. <p> " Diane. " He sighs. " I do n't want to hear it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about our bet? " <p> " What about it, you won. You get Helga. " <p> " That was n't the bet. " <p> Dave and I now embark on a staring contest. It 's not fair though, because he is all folded up on the couch, and I 'm out in the middle of the room, on display. So, of course I 'm the first to glance at my feet. " What, " I say. <p> " You know what, " he says. <p> " No, what? " <p> " It would n't be good, that 's what. " <p> " It could be good. " <p> " Diane. " The staring is happening again. <p> " What. " <p> He laughs. " Shut up with the whats already. " <p> " You shut up. " <p> " That 's it. I 'm going canoeing. " He stands, picks up the lantern. <p> " But, Dave, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knuckle rub on the head, and he leaves. <p> My shoulder hurts and I press my hand to it. I sit on the couch until I 'm sure it 's quiet below, then I walk down to the bedroom. Charlie is reading in the armchair. Kali is asleep on the bed. She 's been scrubbed and jammied. She lies across the bed as if she threw herself there, her arms raised, her white nightgown twisted up to her waist, her face red and smeared from crying. <p> " She wanted you, " he says, not looking up. <p> " Kali 's my hero, " I say. <p> " We 'll hire a tow tuck in the morning. " <p> " I 'm going down to the dock for a while. " <p> He looks up from the book with reassuring, sad eyes. " We 've caused a great deal of damage, but we can fix this, Diane. " <p> I stumble in the dark towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's paddle and see the little light as it moves down the channel into Eagle Lake. <p> I wonder if she 's out there with him, but then I see Anna. She 's naked, as usual, and sitting on the roof of her car, gazing stiffly out to sea. <p> " Is n't that a little over dramatic, " I call. <p> She does n't answer. The little plastic things float and glint on the water. <p> I take off my clothes and wade in. Have I mentioned that I hate cold water? My toes sink into the sludge. I think of broken glass from the car wreck. I feel my way, on my toes, trying to test for the sharp edge of glass before it cuts me, then climb onto the submerged hood, all the butterflies scraping my knees. I pull myself onto the roof and sit beside her. I can feel the wings pressing into my butt. <p> " Charlie 's going to have it towed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He broke up with me, " she says. <p> " He always does that. " <p> " I guess you 're the only woman he 's ever loved, " she says. <p> " I 'm not really a woman. " <p> " More like a monster? " She watches her toes. <p> I watch her. I imagine sliding my fingers all the way down, It would be prickly there, where she shaves. We 'd be breathing hard, hardly acting, hardly holding back, so close to real. <p> She looks up. " What. " <p> " I feel reckless tonight. " I run my finger down her arm. <p> I know she 's thinking about it, Dave and I could be twins, and she could have me, she could recoup her losses. But she decides to recoup them in a different way. <p> " No, thanks, " she says. " I 'm going back to St. Paul. " <p> She slides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's late now. Kali and Charlie asleep, the light is off from that window, Anna, somewhere, Dave, out there, somewhere. The moon is just a knife edge, the lake is black and still. There are mosquitoes whining, Let 's dance. I love you. Whining, This ca n't be over. <p>
