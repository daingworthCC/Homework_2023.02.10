1014441 Hot season, 1973, and Randy Cooper, whose father worked at the American embassy in Chiang Mai doing something that involved water buffalo, could not believe that David was such a dickwad that he had never ever seen a real movie in a real movie theater, indeed, had never seen a movie in his entire life. " I told you, " David said. He was twelve years old. " We used to live in the jungle. I mean, really in the jungle, where there was n't even electricity and stuff. I had a pet tiger. I told you. " " Still a dickwad, Tarzan. " With Randy Cooper 's explosive " dickwad, " David realized that everything had changed. Since the family 's arrival in Chiang Mai a little over two years earlier, David had been trading on the story of his adventures in the jungle, his account of the family 's lonely homestead in the farthest reaches of northern Burma reaching a stirring crescendo with his account of his pet tiger. The story had produced big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways " in the more skeptical sixth grade, until David produced for his classmates a photograph of himself with Elijah Cat in his lap. Aunt Helena showed me the photo : a bare-chested boy with a sweet goofy smile and an awful homemade haircut, sitting cross-legged on a bamboo floor with an honest-to-God tiger cub bent backward over his thigh. All four of the tiger 's paws were in the air, and David was rubbing its belly. So it was all true after all. David had been enrolled in the fifth grade( at age level, to his grandmother 's pride), when they came over from Eden Valley, and through the end of sixth grade, that photograph, explaining David 's oddness and proving his extraordinary pedigree, had been the difference between dorkhood and grudging popularity. But even the most wonderful story, told too often, loses the power to compel ; and David 's, which was his little part of the story the Walkers told of themselves, now provoked only withering glances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had heard the jungle stories when David did n't know how to play dodgeball ; when he admitted that he had never heard of the Rolling Stones ; when he could n't ride a bicycle ; and when he was n't sure just who the president of the United States was-although David could have easily identified a dozen varieties of snake and pronounced them poisonous or benign, ably assisted in the construction of a thatch-and-bamboo home, identified all of the signs of the Rapture, or recited more lines of Scripture than anyone in school cared to hear, in both Dyalo and English. Indeed, by seventh grade David was no longer even the possessor of the most exotic story in class : Sarabeth Morgan 's parents had been aid workers in Laos, and Sarabeth had grown up in a Hmong village, until the family was driven out by the war. She had seen a massacre, and had lost an adopted brother. She had arrived in Chiang Mai just this year, and her fresh stories made David 's tales seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put the photo of Elijah Cat back in the album and begin to accept that Eden Valley was gone forever, and that he lived now in Chiang Mai, where people went to the movies if they did n't want to be dickwads. Not very long after his encounter with Randy Cooper, David decided to defy his father 's unspoken but omnipresent code of personal conduct and go see the Englishlanguage movie of the week at the Kamtoey Theater, where was showing an entirely forgettable and now almost entirely forgotten blaxploitation film called Blacula, which the very same Randy Cooper, who brooded over the seventh grade like an incubus, the week before had said was so funny it almost made him piss himself. Thomas had never specifically told his eldest son that he was not allowed to visit the Kamtoey Theater, but David knew his father was far too subtle a psychological tactician to prohibit outright a forbidden pleasure. Not long after the Walkers arrived in Chiang Mai, Linda-Lee had begun reading Cosmopolitan magazine, which she borrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell Linda-Lee that if she looked at that magazine one more time she 'd be headed straight to the burning pits of Hell, which in Thomas 's mind was not very far from the truth ; but when he happened to notice a copy of Cosmo in Linda-Lee 's book bag, the fifty-one-year-old Thomas began very publicly to read the magazine himself. Linda-Lee came home from school one day to find her father on the couch absorbed in an article about trimming the pubic regions, and at dinner with the whole family Thomas asked Linda-Lee if she had read that same fascinating article about how to seduce a man in six minutes or less? The funny thing was, Thomas continued, that was precisely how Mom had won his attention all those years ago, and was it working well for Linda-Lee? Linda-Lee went quiet as a puddle of water at the table. The very last thing the fifteen-year-old girl wanted to do was publicly compare her mother 's quondam abilities as a seductress with her own. Can you imagine, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this silliness when other people on this planet still lived as slaves? Norma went tsk-tsk wearily, and Grandpa Raymond shook his patriarchal gray head from side to side. You could almost hear the bags under his eyes go swish-swish in disapproval. Linda-Lee wished that the ever-present gaping maw of Hell would swallow her up right then and there. So to go to the Kamtoey Theater, which if discovered would have subjected him to his father 's mockery, David was forced to lie to his father, which if discovered would have subjected him to his wrath. In preparation for his first visit to the cinema, David announced to his mother that he had joined the swim club, which met from four to six on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons.( Except at the height of the rainy season, when the pool, for reasons no one could explain, turned a violent cucumber green and widespread student opinion held that to dip so much as a toe in the water would lead to an agonizing death by slow-creeping gangrenous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you catch my horrifying drift, a terrible thing which really happened to some poor kid in the tenth grade. In the rainy season, David thought it prudent to play volleyball.) But attendance at athletic clubs was optional, and David explained to the swim teacher that he was expected that evening at a church youth group meeting. Thus having fashioned himself a solitary afternoon in the hot season, David went to the Kamtoey Theater, by bicycle, directly and absolutely alone, first dodging traffic on the Charoen Muang Road, then over the Nawarat Bridge, crowded with bicycles, motorcycles, trishaws, tuk-tuks, and handcarts piled high with bags of rice and cement, past the aromatic flower market with its mountains of roses, orchids, jasmine, and lilies, then into the old city itself through the Tha Pae Gate. The whole way there, David swore to himself that he would never forget the Dyalo again, not even one time, not when the hills which ringed Chiang Mai were throbbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ souls were crying out for liberation-although David did wonder just how two hours of swimming or volleyball, activities which no one disapproved of, would have helped the Dyalo. The question had bothered him enough that he 'd asked his grandfather what he should be doing to help the Dyalo if he was n't going out into the hills and preaching as his dad had done at his age. Grandpa Raymond had nodded in that slow, thoughtful way he had, and said that at the very least, David could pray for the Dyalo. " I take prayer extremely seriously, David. Prayer is often our most effective tool in the Fight. " David was impressed by the serious, manly way his grandfather spoke to him, and decided that he could just as well pray for the Dyalo in a movie theater as in a swimming pool. But the hard truth of the matter was that the very instant David settled himself nervously into the very last row of the Kamtoey Theater, he forgot his vows altogether. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racing and his skin prickling with a fine nervous sweat. He had a theoretical knowledge of film from his mother, who had told him that a film was like a photograph the size of a wall that moved, but the whole notion struck him as somewhat incredible. He wondered how he would describe the film to his classmates tomorrow. Maybe he would say, " It was so funny I peed myself, " although he was not precisely sure how a moving photograph would be that funny, exactly ; or he would say, " It was so scary I almost barfed, " although again, the connection was obscure, between a picture that moved and the kind of cold terror he had felt when, pulling up the bucket from the well not long before the family left Eden Valley, he had found a cobra spitting back. That discovery had in fact provoked David to vomit. The more David thought about barfing, the more he felt just a touch queasy. The Thai do n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rightly consider popcorn proper fare only for pigs, so generations of cinemagoers had come into the theater laden down with meatballs and grilled chicken on skewers, soaked with sweet sticky sauces ; salted dried fish from the vendors lined up outside the theater ; and bowls of noodles drenched in fish sauce, vinegar, sweet kaffir lime, spicy ginger, lemongrass, and galangal, the whole odoriferous concoction to be slurped down all through the show with the aid of chopsticks, whose click-clack against the ceramic bowls could be heard even at moments of highest cinematic tension. The red carpets and thinly upholstered seats had absorbed forty years of spills. The smell was overpowering, although to a nose not distended by guilt and anxiety, not entirely unpleasant. Later in life, David, wandering through the covered spice market or just passing by a street stall, would be instantly transported by a familiar smell back to the Kamtoey Theater and the sweet, illicit afternoons of his adolescence. David thought about going home. His butt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had seen enough of the theater to fake it at school from now on, but not so much as to estrange him from his family. That was the hardest thing to explain to the other kids at school, just why he had never been to the movies. He had only recently begun to suspect that his family, in its enthusiasms and convictions, was different from other families ; and, indeed, the Walkers lived more intensely in the service of the Lord now than they had even in Eden Valley, treating Chiang Mai as little more than a mirage offered up by the Deceiver to distract them from what they needed to do. When they had first come to Chiang Mai and all of them were still living in a two-room house lent them by a wealthy Christian tailor, how admirably flexible in the face of adversity the Walkers proved themselves to be! Raymond and Laura were more than seventy years old, Thomas more than fifty, all of those children, not one Walker speaking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent in the deepest jungle-and the only thing the Walkers knew for sure was that they would not forget the Dyalo! " This was no accident, our coming here! Oh no! God 's planning is coming together, and soon the Day will come. The wind of God had blown us down from China in the north, " said Grandpa Raymond. " And when the storm picks up, do n't you worry, the Dyalo will come running in for Shelter. We 'll be patient like a seed in the earth. " * By giving those old enough to preach a goal, namely the conversion of the Dyalo of Thailand, Raymond distracted them all from the sorrows of exile. And all those old wild wandering Walker impulses, long suppressed in twenty years of jungle domesticity, came out again, to the exclusion of almost all other cares : Thomas, together with Uncle Samuel, Uncle Jesse, and Uncle Paul, devoted himself to learning these strange new hills. Talk at the dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villages, shamans who fought the work and headmen who-Praise! -were coming close to the Light. The Dyalo in these hills were strange and different, their dialect outlandish, but the Walkers knew them. Even Raymond with his bad hip could n't keep from going into the hills and limping from village to village, as he had n't done since he himself was a young man, and when the men came down from ten days, two weeks, a month in the mountains, caked in mud, their faces were flushed red because they had felt His power. David did n't even need to ask what his father would think of his decision to see Blacula. If you have time on your hands, son, fray for those folks in Mae Salop. That 's what his dad would say. David had almost convinced himself to leave the theater when the lights went down. He gripped the arm rails of his seat. The roller coaster rolling slowly upward, a plane in heavy turbulence, a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrotum and cloaca. He wondered : Why had he bothered to lie to his mother? As if God could n't see him sitting here? As if God could n't afford a ticket to the movies, God who had made the universe? What had he been thinking? Why, he wondered, had nobody told him that movies were in the dark? Then bats. That was the first thing he heard. From up above, the hysterical shrieking of a flock of bats swooping down from above, a flock of idiot bats who nested in the rafters of the old theater. Confused by the unexpected and untimely alternations of light and dark, the bats flapped and dove, as strange lights began to play across the screen, accompanied by loud music, which David recognized from school assemblies as the Royal Anthem. On the screen, the bright colors coalesced into the form of a man, and then a crowd, then dissolved and disappeared just as quickly, before David could quite decide what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his mother said : the screen was all one moving photograph. He saw the king of Thailand on the screen. In his anxiety David had hardly noticed the others in the audience, but now, looking around, he realized that he was the only one still sitting. He stood up. David knew that when presented for the very first time with a photograph, many Dyalo, particularly the old people, have trouble interpreting it. It would only be colors and lines to them. They would hold it right up close to their eyes and then far away, then upside down or sideways, and would call their wives over, and say, " Do you see anything here? " and David would say, " Do n't you see? That 's a nose and that 's eyes and that 's a mouth there. " And still the old Dyalo just would n't get it, until all of a sudden, like someone examining those optical-illusion puzzles that show either a candlestick or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they 'd figure out what was going on-although each new photograph would still require long scrutiny before the " Ahhah, is n't that clever! " moment. Now David found himself in the same confused position. There were photographs of the king on the walls of every shop in Chiang Mai, but this-this was another thing entirely. What his mother had never mentioned was that the photograph was constantly changing. The king would appear in one place and then in another, on the left side of the screen and on the right, an older man and a younger man, dressed in a suit and then in the ochre robes of a Buddhist monk, and then in a military uniform, and then in the elaborate royal gowns. David would only begin to figure out who the king was, and then the king would disappear again. Sometimes the king would move, but sometimes the camera rotated and advanced, even gained altitude and perspective, while the king stayed in the same place. There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady ; then the king in a military jeep. The king was driving, his regal face a study in concentration. Now the king was on elephant back heading up into the hills. Bats flew across the king 's face. The king 's jeep was driving toward the camera, and David involuntarily ducked and then a second later stood up straight again, feeling foolish. Then the anthem swelled to its dramatic crescendo and the screen went black. The bats who lived in the rafters of the Kamtoey Theater retreated to their nesting place. David sat back down in the dark, breathless. This was more than he expected. He had only seen the minute-long tribute to the king of Thailand that precedes the showing of every film throughout the kingdom, but David was confirmed in the very secret suspicion that he shared with every other thirteen-year-old in the world : that God and his parents really did wish to deprive him of the best pleasures in life. All this even before the show began. Sidebar Excerpted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farrar, Straus and Giroux, LLC. Copyright c 2007 by Mischa Berlinski. All rights reserved.
