1009041 Most of us just have one option when things get too crowded. The Astral Astronauts have another. <p> Okay, so it was a dumb idea. What can I say ; we were in love at the time. We thought we always would be. But two years cooped up together, three couples in a starship no bigger than a mail shuttle, showed us how ephemeral that could be. We knew we were in trouble the day Liam tried to kill Yavetra. Etinitu had been trying to delete Tilbey at least once a week for the last couple of months, but we all secretly hoped she 'd succeed. Kylona and I had discovered that it was actually kind of erotic to describe in detail how we would like to do each other in, so everybody knew we were n't really serious. But Liam and Yavetra had been inseparable since before we 'd left Islandia. If they started going after each other 's throats, we were in worse shape than we thought. Tilbey caught Liam in the act, which was appropriate since Liam had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day, which was why he was trying to kill her now. Different acts, of course, but maybe not that different in the long run. Both involved destroying something precious to Liam. " Oh, great, another meeting, " Kylona said disgustedly when she heard what had happened. We 'd been holding group discussions more and more often lately, trying to talk out our problems before they overwhelmed us. Talking did n't do much good, but it was either a meeting or a duel, and with our ship light-years from home we did n't need any broken equipment. So we all gathered in front of the multimedia console in the " day room " -the only place on board the Spook big enough for all six of us at once-and prepared for another round of acrimony and tears. It would have been quite a scene to a passing alien, if there had been any out there at the time. Six milky-white ghosts drifting weightless inside our coasting starship, its walls wide open to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep our belongings from drifting away. We moved our lips to speak, but of course we made no sound in the vacuum. When Tilbey and I and Liam had first shed our bodies to become interstellar astronauts, we had required hardware implants in our throats and jaws to interpret our motions and translate them into speech, but on the long trip to Alpha Centauri, Tilbey had played around with the programming of our mass eliminators and devised a way to detect the simulated muscle impulses at their source. That eliminated the need for implants but not for the motions, so we jabbered away at each other like characters in a silent movie while the computer provided sound in our simulated eardrums. We might as well have said nothing for the first half hour. Accusations and recriminations were all we uttered, and we did n't even make up any interesting new ones. Finally Kylona said, " Hey, this is getting us nowhere. We 've got to figure out how to get along for the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up dead. " " One of us wo n't, " Liam said gruffly. She gave him a pitying look. " Do you really think any of us-even you-could survive the next three years alone in this ship? After knowing you had murdered the rest of us? How long would it take before your guilty conscience drove you crazy? " " You mean crazier than I am now? " He held out his hands. " Look, babe, I 'm already seeing ghosts, and frankly, you do n't scare me. " " Maybe I would if I took a little stroll through your mass eliminator. " The magnetically enhanced standing wave that made up her body would fry the electronics in his ghost generator the moment she slipped inside it. Of course she would have to get through two layers of safety precautions before she could reach it, but that would only slow her down. She had been studying electronics and mechanics during her time on board ; she was almost as good as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know you better, I 'd think you were making a pass at me. Save your death threats for your boyfriend, Kylona. I 've got troubles enough without adding yours to the mix. " They stared at each other with a mixture of hatred and lust that only people who have shared the same living space for two years can produce. I was starting to worry, considering what Kylona found erotic these days, but Etinitu defused the situation by saying, " Hey, come on. The problem is really about space, not life or death. " Liam looked past me to her. " The problem is five other people who do n't have the self-discipline for an interstellar journey. " She rolled her eyes. " Who needs self -- discipline with you telling us all what to do all the time? " He opened his mouth to argue, but I cut him off. " Look, we 're all driving each other nuts, and Etinitu is right : it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. We need to get away from each other for a while. " Kylona said, " I thought that was what we were trying to accomplish when we made separate staterooms for everybody. " " We were, " I agreed, " but the staterooms are too small to stay in for long. " " So let 's make them bigger. " Tilbey shook his head. " This is a starship, not an apartment building. We 've pared its mass down so much already that it 's as fragile as glass. If we start moving struts, it 'll collapse like a house of cards the first time we use the thrusters to dodge a rock. " " How many rocks have we had to dodge since we left home? " she asked him. " None, " he answered, " but the radar has found a big one a couple months ahead of us that we 're only going to miss by a million kilometers. Who knows what kind of debris is floating around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well, then, how about if we start living on the outside of the ship? There 's lots of space out there. " " That 's a great idea, " Liam said. " You guys all go on outside, and III stay here with the book readers and video players and the- " " I meant we could move that stuff outside and- " " And let it drift off to Aldebaran the moment the ship makes a course correction. " She glared at him. " We could tie it down. " " You were perhaps planning to lock Tilbey up first? " He did n't need to say more. No matter how much Liam bugged him about it-perhaps because Liam bugged him so much about it -- Tilbey seemed to sow disaster wherever he went. The moment he got distracted, he would leave whatever he was doing parked in free fall, completely forgetting it until he needed it again, whereupon he would spend half the day hunting for it among the hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tilbey knew enough to keep quiet. The rest of us floated there in silence as well, glaring at one another and waiting for the next bright idea to shoot down. I tried to think of one, just to be sporting, and nobody was more surprised than me when I actually came up with something. " If we ca n't make the Spook bigger, " I said, just thinking aloud more than actually suggesting anything, " How about if we make the individual spooks on board smaller instead? " Liam looked at me like I was a moron, but he did n't bother to say so. Kylona cocked her head sideways, as if to decide if she 'd heard me correctly. Yavetra narrowed her eyebrows, and Etinitu frowned. But it was a thoughtful frown. We all looked at Tilbey. " What? " he said, jerking alert when he realized he was the focus of attention. " Can we do that? " I asked. Despite his clumsiness, he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up fast. " Do what? " Tilbey asked. " Make ourselves smaller. " Now he frowned. Rubbing his chin, he said, " I do n't... well, maybe if I... I 'd have to recalibrate the- " " Can you do it? " Ham demanded. " We can do it, " Kylona said. I looked over at her, still amazed at her transformation even though I had watched it in action. She had been a naked tropical island native just two years ago, but she 'd taken to technology like a teenager to credit. " How small? " I asked her. " How small do you want? Theoretically we could go clear down to the molecular level, but we 'd start having trouble with quantum shifts in the information stream at that scale. " I had been thinking mouse size, but I suddenly realized I was being too conservative. " We could actually get down to microbe size? like bacteria? Viruses? " Tilbey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be getting into the gray area. Your eyes would be too small to pick up light, for one thing. " " Bacterial size would be small enough. " I tried to remember how many bacteria could fit onto the head of a pin. A thousand? More? The Spook was two hundred and fifty feet long and forty feet wide ; if we were the size of bacteria, it would be big enough to keep us from bumping elbows no matter how long we stayed on board. Six ghosts looked at one another across the day room. Then, as one, we all shouted, " Let 's do it! " It took Tilbey and Kylona a week to alter our mass eliminators to allow us to shrink and grow at will. As with the coupling constant that governed our interaction with matter, we could n't get infinite power out of it, so we could n't stride across the cosmos in light-year sized leaps, but we could shrink as far as we wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again in the day room while Tilbey told us how to control our new ability. " The computer will respond to verbal commands, " he said. " It 'll try to keep you from doing anything stupid, but I 'm sure we have n't been able to think of everything, so be careful what you tell it to do. " Liam snorted, but Tilbey ignored him and went on. " Your feet will always be the reference point for body placement. That way you wo n't wind up hanging three feet away from the floor when you shrink. " But watch your head when you expand again, " Kylona added. " If you 're underneath something, you 're going to bang into it. " Tilbey nodded absently. " We 'll still be able to hear each other if we want to, or we can scale down our hearing range to give us privacy. Even then, if you shout someone 's name the computer will connect you, so do n't worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shut it off completely? " Liam asked. " You do n't. That would be stupid. In an emergency, the computer needs to be able to page you. " Tilbey turned toward Kylona without waiting for a reply. " You want to demonstrate how it works? " " Sure. " She pushed herself up to the ceiling, reoriented herself so her feet touched the surface, and said, " Command, body scale one one-thousandth. " I had expected her to wink out like a burst soap bubble, but instead she shrank over a period of a couple of seconds. Apparently her mass eliminator could n't compensate instantly for the scale change. It did n't matter, really, but it was kind of alarming to watch. It looked as if the ship had sucked her into it. " Are you OK? " I asked. I could see a tiny white speck on the ceiling that I assumed was her. " Fine, " she said. Her voice was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try it. " All right. " I pushed myself backward until I was against one of the few solid spaces in the wall-an access panel for the wiring conduits-then echoed her command. Everything else in the room flew away from me like shrapnel from an explosion. " Whoa! " I said. " What 's the matter? " I laughed. " Nothing. I just was n't ready for the light show. " I looked around me. Deep grooves lined the metal. It had been silver before, not quite mirror-finished, but it was gray now and pitted with holes and bumps. Were those actual molecules? I bent down to look closer and decided they were n't. They still had rough edges. I 'd have to go ten, maybe even a hundred times smaller to see individual molecules. The ceiling looked like it was about five miles away. The view reminded me of Freeport, the UN 's orbital space station back home. Except four giants filled the space where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long. One by one, Liam, Tilbey, Yavetra, and Etinitu each chose their territory and shrank to invisibility. " Everyone okay? " Tilbey asked when the " oohs " and " aahs " had subsided. He got a flurry of affirmatives, then Liam 's voice said, " Command, reduce hearing sensitivity to minimum. " " ' Bye! " I told him, but he did n't respond. Maybe he was already out of touch. " Well, " I said to the others, suddenly reluctant to cut my last link with them, " give me a call if you get bored. " " Yeah, right, " said Tilbey. Yavetra and Etinitu giggled. Kylona said, " Be careful, Danny. " " You too, " I told her. And then I said " I love you, " because now that we were effectively farther apart than we had been in years, I realized I still did. " I love you too, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do n't call me for a while, okay? " " I was n't planning on it, " I said, wounded. Tilbey laughed, then gave the command to isolate himself. I did the same a moment later, then I looked around at my surroundings to see where I wanted to go first. It really did n't matter. I could reach any place I wanted in a few seconds merely by expanding, moving over a few feet, and shrinking again. But the whole point of shrinking was to gain more personal space, so I decided to just stretch my legs a little, figuratively speaking, and explore my new domain. It turned out to be a literal leg-stretcher. When I pushed myself gently away from the wall, kicking off one of the ridges of metal and planning to just drift along for a while, I was surprised to feel a tug on my feet before they came loose. I coasted for a few body lengths, but within a few seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " I got my feet under me before I hit and felt them slap the surface. It felt a little like I was wearing magnetic boots. I took a few experimental steps. Sure enough, my feet stuck. Not much, but enough to notice. I bent down and tried my hands ; same thing. Molecular adhesion? Adsorption? I could n't remember the right name, but I did remember that I 'd heard about the effect back in my college days. It was the reason why spinning fan blades could still gather dust, and why evacuated vessels could still hold air molecules. You actually had to go in and sweep them out if you wanted a pure vacuum. The effect was just enough to keep me from floating, but not enough to let me walk, so I reduced my scale a little and tried it again. Now the pits in the metal were like Lunar craters, and the scrapes like ditches, but I could walk almost normally around and over them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 'd discovered, but I decided to let them figure it out on their own. I think that decision marked the point at which I truly started to relax. I could just let the others be. Amazing. So I walked. Every now and then I would encounter a boulder. Dust grains, I assumed. I kicked a few of them loose, pitching them off into the void like a kid tossing rocks off a cliff, but I stopped when one made a U-turn and nearly whacked me on the head. We must have had opposite electrical charges or something. I did n't know, but it was clear that things did n't work the same as I expected them to on this scale. Then I saw the forested knoll. It looked so incongruous out there on the metal plain that it took me a while to accept what I was seeing, but it was still there after I blinked and rubbed my eyes so I walked toward it, watching it loom up out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an approaching boat. It looked so much like a tropical island, complete with palm trees, that I seriously doubted my sanity, but when I got closer I realized what it was. Fungus is one of the biggest problems on board a spaceship. You 've got to have enough humidity in the air to keep the crew healthy, but no matter how good your circulation system, there 's bound to be condensation somewhere. And wherever you get condensation, you get mildew. The Spook had n't been exposed to moisture-heck, it had n't even held air-for years, but it had a long life as a cargo ship before we converted it into an interstellar explorer. And no matter how fastidious the crew, they could n't keep gunk from growing on the walls. We had n't bothered to clean it before we 'd gutted the life-support system. We were already dead by then ; what did we care? But now I realized I cared a great deal. I ran the last few millimeters to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and climbed up between the spore stalks to the top, feeling more at home than I had since Islandia. In all this sterile hardware, I 'd found an oasis. Up close there was no mistaking the hyphae for palm trees, but I did n't care. They were tall and biological, which was good enough for a guy who had n't seen so much as a blade of grass in two years. I plopped down on the " ground " at the base of one of them, folded my hands behind my head, and leaned back against the trunk. From the hilltop I could see all the way to the edge of the bulkhead in all directions. There was n't a horizon ; just a vanishing point where things on my current scale became too distant to resolve anymore. Normal-sized objects were still as clear as a bell, though. The latch to the access panel I was on towered upward in the distance, and beyond that a porthole stared at me like the eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a dozen more clumps of mold, and a pile of debris that dwarfed even them. I could n't tell what it was from here ; maybe a piece of lint or a full-blown dust bunny. I might go investigate later, but for now I was content to sit under a tree and let my mind wander. Now that I had a little distance from the others, it was time to explore the space inside my head as well as the space outside it. This was a nice respite, but I wondered if we 'd actually solved our problem. Living apart might keep us from killing each other, but it would n't repair the damage we had already done. No matter how much time or distance we put between us, we had attempted to murder each other. It would be hard to forget that. Every time we argued from now on, we would wonder if it would blow up into another attempt on our lives. I did n't know what to do about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes more disastrous than leaving them alone. I thought about our options, but in the end I decided to just wait a while and see how things went. As a ghost I did n't have to worry about finding food. I still liked to sleep, though. I took a long, satisfying nap there on my desert island, woke up delighted to realize that my dream was real, and celebrated by taking another nap. When I 'd had enough of that, I explored some more, finding topological delights in such things as woven tiedown straps and nonskid grating. The days blended together. Once, the ship lurched beneath my feet, sending me tumbling head over heels before I caught hold of a barrel-sized metal filing sticking up from a rivet. " Computer, what just happened? " I asked, and its calm voice replied, " The collision avoidance system has diverted us around an oncoming obstacle. " " Oh. " So there were rocks out there after all. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dusted myself off and considered calling the others to make sure they were okay, but I realized I did n't have to do that. " Computer, is everyone else all right? " I asked. " All six crewmembers are unharmed, " it replied. So I continued on mv way. In a storage net, I found a sealed bottle that still had a whiff of air in it, and when I lowered my coupling constant and squeezed inside I discovered that the thermal motion of the air molecules gave me a pretty good massage. Later I found a piece of fiberglass and a piece of lint and learned that if you straddled the glass rod and rubbed it with the lint, you could build up a static charge, and then if you pushed dust particles down toward the end of the glass rod, they 'd fly off into space and the reaction would kick you the other way. It made a crude but effective rocket. I was crossing the space between the aft bulkhead and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my eye. It was something big. I turned my head, expecting to see one of my shipmates grown tired of playing microbe, and I did see something vaguely man-shaped floating in the open space where the airlock used to be, but I could n't make the image resolve into anything familiar. It looked like whoever it was was covered in cellophane. Had Tilbey gotten tangled up in a plastic bag or something? But the bag would n't expand with him unless he 'd set his coupling constant all the way to maximum. Then I realized whoever it was had eight limbs. " Holy shit, " I whispered. Did we have a spider on board? The hair on the back of my neck stood straight out. How could a spider have survived this long without air or food? It looked like it had wrapped itself in a cocoon, but I could n't see how that would help. It was definitely alive, though. Its limbs waved back and forth, and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship. Right toward me. " C-c-command, body scale normal! " I yelled. I forgot that everything in the room would look like it was rushing toward me when I got larger. I threw out my hands to ward off what seemed to be an impending implosion...... and scared the daylights out of the alien who had just come in through the open frame of the airlock. We were even. I screamed louder than I had when I 'd died. I had misjudged the scale. This was n't a garden spider ; it was about half as tall as me, with a head like an artichoke on a barrel-shaped torso and eight arms sticking out from the sides. The moment it saw me, the petals on its head stuck straight out, filling its spacesuit helmet like a puffer fish that forgets it 's in a goldfish bowl. It fired what I first thought was a weapon in its lower left hand, but when the reaction drove the creature backward, I realized it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's the matter? " Kylona asked, and a moment later I heard four other voices ask the same thing. My scream must have triggered the computer 's emergency call to everyone. " Visitors! " I shouted. " We 've got visitors! " I cursed myself for not thinking to tell the damned computer to warn us about approaching ships, but who would have thought there would be any in the cold, thin darkness between stars? All we 'd told the computer to do was avoid obstacles, and once the alien matched courses for docking, it would no longer be considered an obstacle. The alien shook its head. Whatever it had done to itself looked to have been painful. But it did it again a moment later when Liam sprang to full size across the room. Yavetra popped down from above, and Etinitu right beside her. They had apparently been exploring the ceiling together. The individual stalks that made up the alien 's head writhed like snakes, then slowly started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palms out, and said, " It 's all right. It 's not really what it looks like. " " Yeah, right, we 're not really ghosts, " Liam said sarcastically. " Whoops, I was wrong, we are. " It did n't matter what we said, of course, since the alien could n't hear us and we could n't hear it, but I turned to Liam and said " Shut up " anyway. Then I turned back to the alien and gestured for it to come forward again. The thought occurred to me that it might be hostile, but I was so starved for outside contact that I think I would have welcomed an invasion force if they would just talk to me in the process. The alien did n't look hostile anyway. It reached behind itself for the cargo net we had strung across the doorless airlock, all eight hands scrabbling madly to find the opening it had let itself in through. " Computer, can you detect any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Affirmative. Extremely high frequency, amplitude modulated. " " Link us up. " " Linked. " " It 's OK, buddy, " I said softly, knowing it could n't understand me, but hoping that my tone of voice would tell it I was friendly. " Welcome aboard. Excuse the reception, but we were n't expecting visitors. " Its voice was a warbling moan. I did n't need to know its language to know it was terrified. Yavetra kicked off gently and did a slow tumble to land on her feet on the floor. The creature 's moans changed pitch. They died down a little when she reached up to help Etinitu down. That apparently was n't the sort of behavior it expected from a ghost. Then Tilbey blossomed to full size underneath the multimedia console. Books went flying, their screens flickering like strobes as they hit the walls and ceiling. The whole cabinet ripped loose and crashed against the wall next to the airlock. And where it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head and shouting, " Ow owwwww oooowwww ow! " The alien ripped a new hole in the cargo net and flung itself outside. I stuck my head out after it just in time to see it fire its reaction pistol and arc around the flank of the Spook to where its own ship waited, engines hot. " Do n't go! " Yavetra shouted, but the moment the alien reached its airlock, the ship shivered like a dog shaking water off its coat and disappeared in a brilliant streak of light. " Shit, " I said. " The first new face to talk to in years and we scare him off. " Liam said nothing. He just advanced on Tilbey, grabbed him around the neck with both hands, and squeezed. " Hey! " Tilbey shouted. " Cut it out. Hey, that hurts. " He kept on hollering long after Liam had crushed his throat. The computer that picked up his speech did n't care. Finally he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vanished back into the floor. Liam stomped on the spot where he 'd been, but that only sent Liam careening up to the ceiling. " Hah, missed me, " Tilbey said. Liam bounced all around the room, ransacking it for a weapon. We had pistols in the lander, but they would n't hurt a ghost, and they would n't have satisfied his bloodlust anyway. He flexed his hands a few times, then pushed himself over to the spot where Tilbey had disappeared. " Command, body scale one nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety -- ninth, " he growled, and a moment later he vanished. " I 'm coming for you, Tilbey, " he said. He 'd just shown that he could n't kill one of us with his bare hands, but that was n't going to stop him from trying. I looked out at the stars again, stars that seemed even farther away now than they had before. There was no catching our visitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the best we could do was fifty. Unless he came back, we still had three years of travel time ahead of us, and now our onboard animosity had spread to a new dimension. Kylona came in through the hatch leading to the cargo hold. She had evidently been doing her exploration back there. " Sounds like I missed all the fun, " she said gloomily. I turned to face her. She and Yavetra and Etinitu were floating amid the wreckage of the entertainment center, their dismay written all over their faces. What could I do to cheer them up? For that matter, what could I do to cheer me up? On a long voyage, you learn to make do with what 's available. " On the contrary, " I said, taking a micromagnifier from the workbench and bending down to see if I could spot Liam and Tilbey. " It looks like the fun is just beginning.
