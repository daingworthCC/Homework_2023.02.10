Will : What if black people did n't have to register? What if they did n't have to go down to the county courthouse at all? James : They ca n't vote without doing that. I do n't understand. Will : The people in charge of voting are n't letting black folks pass the voting test. So let 's have our own mock election. We 'll call it the Freedom Vote!

Farmer : Is that so? Fannie Lou : That 's so. We got " Doc " Henry running for governor, and the Reverend Ed King for lieutenant governor. Farmer : Doc Henry. He 's a good man!

But something important happened today. Mr. Taylor : It felt good to cast my vote. I liked being able to have a say, like other Americans. Fannie Lou : About 90,000 people voted in our special election. Mrs. Cobb : I guess people ca n't keep saying that black folks are n't interested in voting. Fannie Lou : That 's right. But you know what 's even more important? Doc Henry got more votes than the man who won the election! Mrs. Cobb : You mean if we were registered and actually voted in the real election, Doc Henry could have won? Fannie Lou : Yes. Until that happens, though, we have to take whatever victories we can. We have taken our first steps to freedom! Afterword Fannie Lou Hamer continued the fight to make it easier for blacks to vote. She ran for governor and state senator later in life, hut lost. Though she died in 1977, her work lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any other state in the union.
