1014241 Words would not bring Lila Feldhaus 's son home from Pelton. During his visit Abner had waited for their words with toothy excitement ; knowing what they would say, he also knew how to answer them. A mother 's power was and always would be in the elements, the things of the world. What would bring her son home? Only a giant Van Buren ball at the county canvass at the end of October, one big enough to dwarf that Whig John Washburn 's Harrison ball and dwarf John Washburn, too, and remind Abner where he belonged and whom he belonged to. The realizations woke her. Lila Feldhaus scraped the back of her hand across her mouth. Her husband Louis slept beside her, his thin lips laced with drool. Asleep, his breath snarled against the world like a hatchet against wood, but awake he was silent as a stone. She used to resent Louis 's diurnal silences, but for the last few months, since Abner, only fourteen, left them to clerk for that Whig John Washburn, she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything? Her husband was a decent man, a Methodist, a steady reader of agricultural journals, a reliable Democrat. Long ago he had nailed up a campaign poster for an Andrew Jackson rally in Pelton. In the poster, Jackson looked cruel, black-eyed, almost Cherokee. Sometimes Louis spoke to the picture. " Kill you any bankers, today, Andy? " But now Andrew Jackson was dead, and that Whig Harrison had the knives out for poor little Van Buren, and the world belonged to lawyers like John Washburn and not to farmers like them. Lila lay her fingertips on the jutting bone of Louis 's cheek, not harshly, and he shook her hand away. " A man 's sleep is his only peace. " Louis rolled over, facing the wall. Outside, the pigs scuffled, a goat whined, the tree frogs chirruped. Then, settled, Louis began to snore again, and the noises of the world fell farther away. The moon rising behind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oak table to the narrow mattress where Abner had, until the spring, slept. On top of the mattress lay the red diamond quilt Lila had sewn for him, and that he had not taken to Pelton town. And beside it, the old wooden chest with a busted latch that would not catch, stuffed with clothes that Abner also had not taken to Pelton. Her son Abner had not snored. He breathed slowly, with casual confidence, as if he never expected to stop. Many nights Lila lay there, listening for Abner 's breathing. Still she felt his presence in their house, a smell that did not belong to her or to Louis, a space that they did not quite fill. Lila slid her feet onto the wooden floor, already cool in the October morning. Digging her elbow into the straw, she pushed herself upright, sat a moment at the edge of the mattress, her hands on her knees, her eyes steady in the still light of the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman, but she was, in moments of calm, impressive, even fearful. Abner was the same way, smooth-cheeked but already formidable enough to impress a lawyer like John Washburn. The very things Abner inherited from her had drawn him away from her, too. Walking past the table, Lila skimmed her hand over the white paint. When she reached Abner 's side of the room, she grabbed his chest by the handles, tipped it forward and shook it until all the clothes he left behind, all the clothes that he was ashamed of, fell with soft thuds onto the floor. A buttoned shirt he once wore to Methodist service( the Washburns were Episcopalians), two perfectly good cotton britches with only small patches of repair, a black vest Abner saw in Elmer Woods 's store and begged unaccountably for. His thin dark socks. His white cotton shirts. His underwear. None of it good enough for him now. Lila dropped the chest on the mattress. Once Lila considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rope wrapped around itself, like yarn into a skein, she saw what she would do. She tied the shirts arm to arm, the pants leg to leg, and began to wrap his clothes in widening orbit. By pulling tight and varying her angle, she could make, if not a perfect sphere, at least something that could roll. By the time she had tied all the clothing, the ball was about two feet high, up to her knees. She tucked the last pant leg, gave the ball a little kick. It rolled toward the table without unraveling, struck a chair that creaked and whined. Across the room, her husband Louis sat up on his elbows, blinked his heavy eyes. " John Washburn ai n't the only one who can make a show at the canvass, " she said. " And Harrison ai n't the only one who can have a ball. " Louis scratched his cheek, looked up at the poster on the wall, then back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to roll right over their goddamned Whig smiling faces, " he said. Lila looked down at the table, against the surprise and the joy she felt. In her excitement, Lila kicked the ball, gracelessly, and it bounced under the table and across the floor to her husband 's side of the bed. " There 's your Van Buren ball, " she said. By the time he was twelve, Abner Feldhaus knew that court weeks came once every two months, with an additional and brief docket clearing on odd-numbered Thursdays. By toiling through Sunday( his parents willing to favor the oldest law of work over the relatively novel injunctions of the Scripture) Abner could get far enough in the fields and in his schoolbooks to earn permission to attend court. During trials Abner wrote in a ledger he bought at Elmer Woods 's store. At dinner he followed the lawyers to Frank Pool 's tavern and carried their tankards to the bar for Frank Pool to refill. Abner loved words and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @( and this was the reason he did not study preachers) Abner admired the way that lawyers " words made the world different. One man fined, another sent to the stocks, a third set free. The soil his parents worked, though better than some, was often stone deaf to their pleas, but lawyers had a God 's power to make people new. Abner 's ledger was a record of the world 's stubborn resistance, the shoulder it lowered to slow the lawyers " wheel of progress : testimony of adultery and drunken stupors and short-sighted incendiarism. Fat and walrus-whiskered with a swaying limp he blamed on gout, John Washburn was the host of the lawyers " party when it alighted in Pelton. One day, while Abner Feldhaus filled tankards at the bar, John Washburn snatched the boy 's ledger. He read first quickly, then slowly, drawing his mustache under his lips. When Abner Feldhaus returned, John Washburn held out his hand for the tankard ; he drank, the rum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page. Reaching the end, he slammed his tankard on the table and bellowed at his companions, the leading Whig lawyers of seven counties. " My God, the boy eats words the way a horse eats oats. " He slapped the ledger. " They 're all here, every word we said, digested and packed and squeezed tight. " A lawyer from Radcliffe pointed at Abner Feldhaus, who stood mask-faced but trembling. " You fixing to hire that boy before one of us does? " he asked. " Hire him? " John Washburn said. " I 'm fixing to sit on him and guard him like a hen does an egg. " John Washburn gave Abner practical work, the dull copying every lawyer needed, and a bed of feathers in a room behind the kitchen, a room Washburn and his wife had built for a son who never came. Washburn also gave the boy the speech he wrote and rewrote for the canvass in Pelton, when he would speak for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote for Harrison 's electors. But what Washburn asked from the boy was the truth, the awful sight of his own failed and fumbling words. Hearing them was like staring at the sun. Washburn saw spots ; he winced ; he needed to look away and retreat first to the bench in his front yard, where he rewrote his speech in the dark, and then to Frank Pool 's tavern, where he forgot his limitations and his words and the boy in the back where his son should be. In the evening, Abner Feldhaus copied orders and depositions by candlelight while Washburn 's wife and daughter sipped tea at the kitchen table a wall away. Celia Washburn, somehow cousin to Abner 's mother Lila, was the most beautiful woman in the county, petite and pale-cheeked with dark hair that fell like river rapids down her back. Their daughter Prudence was perhaps the ugliest girl in the town of Pelton, not including the deformed. Birth had scarred her face, leaving a burnt red mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most of her forehead. Already, Abner understood that he was being held in wait for Prudence until he aged into the practice of law, in case Prudence could not find a husband on her own. The thought scared him and excited him both. Abner listened closely as the women talked. " Are the Democrats going to throw another of those dreadful whiskey orgies? " Prudence asked. " Though I 'll be sorry if Father loses, I will be even sorrier if it means the swine fiddling in the streets. " " Let 's have a ball. " Celia was always eager to usher her daughter into public view. " Think of how it would help the campaign. A Democratic bacchanal or a Whig ball. " " A Harrison ball, " Prudence replied. " A big one, with not a Democrat invited. " Say nothing to your father just yet, " Celia said. " Let me start it rolling first. " Although Abner held to words the way a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always understand their meaning. All week the phrase " a Whig ball " swelled in his mind like clouds, obscuring the sky. All week he miscopied depositions, let oral arguments slip from his fingers like water. " It 's your copying earns you your mattress, " John Washburn said. " You want to sleep there, you stay awake when you 're in court. " Abner jabbed his nails into his palm, bit into his lip, let the pain wake him. That Sunday, Abner walked the four miles out of town and up the hills to his parents " farm. While his mother worried over his narrow wrists, his uneaten chicken, he told them about the Whig ball. Saying it, he felt a great physical relief, like a fever breaking in a slow sweat. He did not even notice his parents " scowls. " A Whig? " Louis said. " Rather be a pig. Rather get stomped under some rich man 's boot than choose to lick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's on the ticket, " Abner said. " The man who took me in. " " For four months, " Lila answered. " And who raised you fourteen years? " Despite the argument, Abner felt calm as he walked back to Pelton. November was inevitable-Washburn winning the legislature, voting there with the majority for the Harrison electors, the Harrison electors riding to Washington, D. C., and knocking out that midget Van Buren. Abner 's father could n't change that. And the ball? They would not even remember it. Abner 's mind was cool, a basin emptied and clean. When he reached the Washburns " house, he fell directly asleep. Lila Feldhaus sat down on the ball. By scooting her feet across the floor, she could roll the ball and roll with it, too. But her feet caught, and she tumbled forward onto the floor. Louis helped her up, dusted her off with his hands. They stood by the table, laughing together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis 's fingers tripped down her shoulders. Lila walked her fingers up his arms. Since Abner 's birth, they had been together only infrequently, in stolen moments, court days, times when Abner was away. This time, Lila woke to the sun and to the memory of their first married nights alone in the house Louis and his father built. Noticing the ball alight with the sun from the far window, Lila rose from the bed. Digging through the linens she kept in her old chest, the one she brought with her when she married, she found the sheet that her mother and the midwife Anna Francis laid down upon the floor and fixed in place with buckets of water the night Abner was born. Lila had knelt there, small pillows under her knees, her face nosed deep into the sheet, her teeth biting a blanket, as her mother and the midwife told her push, girl, it wo n't come out on its own. Lila burned ; her mother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to let her rest ; she lay flat on the sheet and refused to move. She spat out the water they cupped into her mouth. Then, finding new strength in her anger, she knelt again. This time, whole worlds spilled from her, liquid and warm. And then the head. And then the white-shrouded baby, who looked perplexed a moment before starting to cry. The sheet still wore the memory of the night, three small red circles near the corner and in the middle a fierce black print the shape of a paw. Her mother had scrubbed the sheet until washing would do no more good, but the stains remained. Now Lila slid her fingers over them, remembering, and then she untucked the pant leg on the end of the ball, knotted the sheet to it, and wrapped the sheet in circles around the ball. The stain showed, which was right, she thought, a record, an at-last acknowledgment of the hurt. As she boiled water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the table. She was shy about the bloodstains. But Louis, when he woke, squatted down and slid his palm over the ball. Then he reached into his own chest and found his town shirt, buttoned and long-sleeved, which he usually wore for market days or occasionally Methodist service. " How bout that, Andy? " he said to the poster on the wall. " Real man do n't need no fine shirt. Though I notice you liked your fine clothes all right. " " Ai n't you going to wear that to the canvass? " Lila asked. " I 'll wear the clothes I am, " he said. " Not the ones that I am not. " For the first few days, the ball was something Louis and Lila Feldhaus shared, like their newly rhythmic conversations about weather and crops and sunlight, like their suddenly vocal lovemaking, like their sense-unspoken but deeply felt-that they now understood the world in a way no one else did. They skipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat on the wooden steps at the back door, watching the shadows overtake the last corn stalks in their garden. One day, shucking the sweet corn, Lila rubbed her fingers over the silk, liquid smooth but still solid. Instead of throwing the silk away, she sewed it onto a white pillowcase, which now glowed a soft and shimmering yellow, a thing as pretty and untouchable as light itself. Lila tied the case to the ball so the ball would glow, too. Seeing it as he came inside from his fields, Louis stopped his scrubbing at the basin. He wiped his fingers across his pants, touched her elbow with his dirty hands. The ball, glowing, seemed to be a new life inside the house. In the middle of the night, when Louis 's snores woke her, Lila thought she could see it, shining under the table, though she knew this was wishful thinking. The ball 's beauty would silence the fancy Whigs at the canvass, who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expensive things. What did it matter if the Whigs " ball was larger? What would it matter if the Whigs " ball was as tall as a house? It was the beauty that counted. Lila and Louis said this to each other, too often. After talking it over, Lila shucked more corn, sewed the silk around the ball 's circumference in the shape of the word " common. " In the evening, around dusk, that word " common " seemed to glow from the ball. It was perfect, they agreed. It was true. But then the widow Elizabeth Mackey called on them from her house on the far side of the hill, as she often did to escape her drunken, foolish son. Although Louis and Lila tucked the ball under the table, they could not lie in the face of her questions. The next day, Elizabeth Mackey visited again, carrying up her husband 's cape, a black and frivolous thing that he had worn on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got elected to the state legislature, voted for Andy Jackson 's electors in the assembly in 1824 and 1828. " Would n't he want to be part of it? " Elizabeth Mackey asked. " Would n't he do it a little honor? " Walter Mackey dead five years now, and still Elizabeth wore black. A memorial. Lila Feldhaus could not say no. They tied the edge of the cape to the pillowcase and wrapped it around the ball. It was so long that it covered everything, the pillowcase and the silk word, shrouded it all in mourning. Elizabeth Mackey laid her palm there. " Give those Whigs hell, Walter, " she said. In the evening the ball seemed to lighten, the black going gray, but Lila could not see the word underneath. " It 's not beautiful anymore, " Lila said to Louis. " If it were me dead and not Walter, you 'd do the same, " he answered. Of course, Lila wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not do it. The next to arrive was Edith Schermerhorn, who lived a full three miles distant and had never visited the Feldhauses at home. On the revival 's last day, she had sat beside Elizabeth Mackey, two widows with the shared suffering of drunken sons, and Elizabeth Mackey told her of the cape and the ball. Edith Schermerhorn did not bring her husband 's clothes. Nor did she speak of the Whigs. Her husband, like her son, had voted with the man who gave him the best whiskey, Democrat, Whig, or otherwise. Edith Schermerhorn carried a child 's quilt. Her son 's only child, a daughter, had died of fever, two years after killing the mother during birth. " She was a fussy girl, " Edith Schermerhorn said, " but we will never have another. For who would marry him now? " Although Lila had her doubts-were n't graveyards the repository for sorrow? - she held her quiet when Louis assented. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " I wrapped her every night. It was the only way to quiet her. " Edith Schermerhorn would not tie the blanket herself. When Louis tugged it from her hands, she covered her mouth with her fingers, watched him cinch it to the cape, then walked out the door, never to return. Lila Feldhaus tapped the ball with her foot. " It ai n't ours anymore, " she said, not with anger but resignation. " It belongs to everybody, " Louis said. " And we are part of everybody too. " Lila put her hand on his. Everybody was one of those words that did n't mean anything, that was just talk, but she did not care to argue with him. Jane Flowers brought her bonnet, an old sweated-brown thing. She did not care about big-bug politics, she said, but John Washburn had prosecuted her for making liquor from her own peaches, got her fined twenty-five dollars, which she would not pay. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kills that bastard. " Jane Flowers tied the bonnet herself, tight, then sat down at the table, as if she expected to be invited for supper, which of course she was n't. A bridle worn by the late Sally, who was Michelle Matthews 's favorite mule. A scarf left behind by Mima Fleming 's daughter when she ran off to Ohio. A tablecloth carried by Jenny Abercrombie, whose husband was a notorious Whig. The tablecloth had belonged to her brother and had not been used since he stabbed his foot accidentally with a hoe and died of the resulting infection. Moccasins that belonged to a Cherokee woman. No one knew what sorrow they carried. A slave from the next county over, in the river valley where there were many of her people, carried a bundle two feet wide of shirts and trousers and robes, thin and muddy. She showed the Feldhauses her pass, written by her master, a Democratic legislator. As she unrolled the bundle, she held up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly Texas or Alabama. After she had handed over all the clothes, she rode off, not in the direction of her plantation. When the patrollers came by the next week looking for her, Lila and Louis said they had not watched her leave. The three patrollers gave Lila and Louis shirts from their saddlebags, claiming their wives had sent them. Two of the patrollers were bachelors, but Lila and Louis did not ask questions. A woman they had never seen walked all the way up from Lewisburg. Arriving at night, she slept on their porch. In the morning, the visitor would not speak to Louis but called Lila out to the garden. There she gave Lila the cloths she wore under her skirts, black with her dried blood. She folded them into Lila 's hands and walked away. Lila stuffed them into crevices into the ball, jamming them where they would not be seen. " It 's a world of hurt, " Louis said. The ball was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lila to lift. Even Louis had to strain. It no longer seemed precious and private. It seemed willful, as if the ball, and not the people who came to their door, were responsible for obscuring its core, the pieces of it that Louis and Lila had given. Sometimes they stayed inside when they heard the knocks, refusing to answer or even to look at the faces that peeked in their windows. Later, when Louis and Lila did open the door, they found stacks of clothes. Who could say what sorrow they carried? The ball no longer seemed to glow but instead to throb like a heart, ignorant of all else around it. Although Lila and Louis still spoke eagerly of the impression it would make upon Abner and John Washburn and the Whigs at the canvass, they no longer liked to look at it. One night, unable to sleep, Louis rolled the ball onto the porch. In the morning, Frank Pool rode up from Pelton with a rag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, he fixed the rag into place and rode away. At the table, Lila and Louis ate their oatmeal, not even looking up from their bowls. John Washburn heard about the ball from Frank Pool, who did not understand its political meaning but thought it only a shrine, a foolish and superstitious thing that any sensible person might make use of. Frank Pool told John Washburn because he knew of Washburn 's hurt, sometimes spoken, at being sonless, and also of Washburn 's shame, never said aloud, at his daughter Prudence 's face. Frank Pool walked the rum to the table where Washburn sat alone, reading his speech by candlelight, speaking words softly to the unresponsive walls. John Washburn was nervous about his speech at the canvass. Instead of easing his fears, Abner Feldhaus 's unpitying transcriptions of the practice speeches Washburn gave during dinnertime had unmanned his confidence. He saw himself too clearly as others saw him, as a pompous, blundering airbag. So he whittled his words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Washburn did not look up when Frank Pool set the tankard on the table, or even when the tavern owner began to speak. Telling John Washburn was a mistake. Instead of laughing at the FeIdhauses " foolishness or mourning his own unborn son, John Washburn pushed back from the table, tucked his ledger under his arm, and stormed out without paying for the two drinks he had already ordered or the three more he would have bought had he stayed his usual stint at the tavern. Frank Pool tapped his pocket, felt the absence of the coins there. " Goddamn Feldhauses, " Frank Pool said. John Washburn walked directly to the kitchen where his wife Celia and his daughter Prudence sat with their tea and their guest lists and the fabric they were sewing into gowns. " A goddamn ball? " John Washburn said. " Can you tell me what that means? " Celia Washburn sewed faster, not lifting her eyes or fingers from the fabric. Prudence cried out that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us, " she said. " You gave to this ball, too? Not enough that the ignorant dirt-eaters want to celebrate the Democrats, but my own family, too? " " Democrats? " Prudence said. " They are n't even invited. " Celia Washburn kicked her daughter under the table. " We do n't have any idea what you are talking about, " she said. " He does. " Washburn pointed at the wall that separated Abner Feldhaus from them. " He 's a goddamn spy sent by his conniving Democrat parents to undermine me. Want to know how to put together a ball of enormous size? Ask him. And tell him if our Harrison ball is n't twice the size of his parents " Van Buren ball, he can crawl back up that hill and copy down the songs of chickadees and cardinals for all I care. " Although Celia and Prudence would have liked to forget about the ridiculous ball of clothes, they did not dare, knowing John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was expelled. They started with Celia Washburn 's wedding dress, simple and white, and one of Prudence 's fine blouses from last year, too small for her now. Unwilling to tie the garments together, they turned their thread and needles from their gowns and sewed the older clothes end to end. Mrs. Washburn 's white dress shone like a tooth. The next morning, they placed a sign on the porch. " Drop off clothes for the Whig ball. " The first to comply were the vicious Barksdale sisters, who thought Celia and Prudence only intended to embroider Whig slogans on their lacy indigo dresses. Celia and Prudence laughed into their sleeves as they sewed them together. Then the Mayberrys and the Cotts and the Yanceys dropped their dresses, too, out of a certainty that the Barksdale girls could not have been wrong. When Frank Pool brought his favorite leather vest, Prudence - sensitive to those who did not mock her - gave Frank Pool a kiss on the cheek. The word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her brother 's rug, which nearly sank the ball under its weight. Michelle Matthews gave her mule 's old halter, Edith Schermerhorn a knitted baby 's cap. Even Elizabeth Mackey brought her husband 's favorite pants. " Would he approve? " Celia Washburn asked. " It being a Whig ball? " Elizabeth Mackey worried her fingers over her wrists. " He 'd approve of winning, " she said. " He loved standing with the victors. The defeated are forgotten as quickly as the Cherokees. " It seemed that everyone who had given to the Feldhauses gave also to the Washburns, except for the escaped slave and the liquor maker Jane Flowers. When the canvass approached, both balls were as tall as men, each too heavy to be lifted. People in Pelton saw the Harrison ball almost every day as they walked past the Washburn house, and its steady growth seemed a simple accumulation. But the Van Buren ball, four miles up in the hills, was seen only by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and only for a few minutes at a time. At Frank Pool 's tavern, when John Washburn was not present, men claimed that the Van Buren ball was as tall as a house, that it caused a deaf man to hear, that it shed tears every night at dusk. No one believed it, entirely, but no one said it was n't true, either. While his wife and daughter collected clothes, John Washburn discovered again his confidence, with the pride of a fellow who finds his pocket watch buried in a field. He had merely mislaid, not lost, something that was inevitably and invariably his. Without Abner 's unmanning transcripts, without that sickening second sight onto himself, John Washburn began to speak more clearly, stare adversaries again in the eye, cower judges with his sneer. It did not hurt that his opponent, a Democrat incumbent from the next county, had reputedly fallen into despair at the escape of a slave girl whom he loved. A little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fitting match for that midget Van Buren. John Washburn grinned into his cup, nodded at a relieved Frank Pool. " I 'll unman that dwarf, " Washburn promised. During those weeks of preparation, Abner Feldhaus hid in his room, composing letters of improper length to John Washburn. Using all the words he knew, Abner wrote desperate and absurd stories, declaring himself a foundling deposited by some mysterious( but probably Whiggish) figure( in later letters perhaps even Harrison himself en route to war) at the doorstep of the hapless or conniving or greedy office-seeking Feldhauses. " This life in Pelton is the life I was meant to lead, " Abner wrote, " and they have sabotaged me since birth, to lure me into a world as silent as a stone, and will you allow them to sabotage me again, when you are the only parent I have? " Abner apologized, explained, analyzed, denounced, and pleaded, but every morning Washburn tossed the new letters into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said, but Celia and Prudence had softened to the boy now that he, and not they, was the primary victim of Washburn 's ire. They slid Abner plates full of bread and pork and gravy and, after the boy begged, ink for his pen and a new ledger from Elmer Woods 's store. The day of the canvass, a dream of wordlessness tortured Abner Feldhaus. In it he opened his mouth, but he could not breathe. His pen, dipped in ink, failed to scar the page. When he woke, he felt gross and fat, like Frank Pool. The house was empty, he walked it as if he did not exist. On the table he found a note written by John Washburn. " Absorption is not the same as education, " it said. " If the Van Buren ball rolls over our Harrison ball, do not bother to return to my home. It is up to you to figure how. " Abner thumbed through the ledger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. It was true ; he had been only a copyist. Now, if he wanted to stay in this palaverous life, he needed to claim his place. The only way he could do that was by helping John Washburn win the canvass. In victory, the Whig would be magnanimous. In defeat, cruel. In the yard, Abner washed his face with water from the pump. The Washburn women draped a banner over the courthouse steps where the speakers would stand. John Washburn rolled the ball through the plaza, leaning forward and nudging it with his shoulders. He moved very slowly, and the ball seemed on the verge of falling backward. Washburn looked bleakly over at Abner but did not nod. Abner considered offering to help, but he knew what the answer would be. His duty now was to sabotage the Van Buren ball. Abner smelled roasting chicken. Soon the Democrats would arrive with whiskey and pork and fiddlers and their own banners, and then it would be too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the hill to his parents " house. It was really a series of hills, the lowlands shouldering their way ledge by ledge toward the distant mountains. At the first plateau he met Elizabeth Mackey walking the opposite direction, toward town, and then Jane Flowers on her horse, and Jenny Abercrombie in a carriage, and Michelle Matthews on her new mule( also named Sally), and Edith Schermerhorn on foot with her drunken son. " You ai n't missing the show? " they asked. " Or the grub? " " Carrying my folks down, " he answered. Each of these people had given something of herself to his parents for their Van Buren ball, but they now seemed to have no concern at all for them. This surprised Abner, and then it did n't. On canvass day, they would deny the Feldhauses three times before the cock crowed, if they thought the Whigs had the better whiskey and the better meat and the better chance at victory. Abner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. He stared angrily at the steep road in front of him. Lila and Louis sat at the table, eating soup with wooden spoons. Their mouths were open around words they had been about to say, but they fell silent when Abner entered. It seemed to Abner that they had been sitting in that same position when he returned to tell them about the Whig ball, and when he left them for Washburn. They were not capable of moving. The ball sat in the corner by his bed. Seeing it, Abner felt a burst of relief. The ball was almost the size of the Harrison ball in town, but no one would think it the equal. It was caked in mud, stank of rot. It, too, did not look like it could move. Abner dragged his foot over the floor. Finally, his mother set her spoon in her bowl and looked up at him. It was an unhesitatingly cold look, one she gave the revival preachers and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You coming? " he said. " To watch your man get crowned? " his mother said. " I think we 'll stay right here. " His father nodded but did not look up. Abner bit back the smile that was growing on his face. It was clear to him what had happened. In their privacy, his parents had come to love the dumb, smelly ball. Having kept it curled under their thumb, they did not want to let it go, as they had not wanted to let him go. It was always the same with them, and only he could change. " You can stay, " he said, " but the ball goes. " He needed to get the ball to Pelton ; John Washburn wanted not to defeat an absent foe but a present one, not victory but humiliation. His father wiped his face with a napkin, then turned around in his chair. Abner walked over to the ball and pushed it. It groaned wetly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood in front of him, pressing his hands on the ball. " It stays, " his father said. " It 's suffered enough in the world, " his mother said. " What about the Mackeys and the Abercrombies and the Schermerhorns? Did they give you their pain so that you could hoard it in private? " Still, his parents did not stir ; they stood beside each other, fingertips lightly touching, two unbending fence posts hammered into the ground. Abner ground his shoulder into the ball, and began to walk it forward, into the door frame. Finally, it sprang onto the porch, carrying a plank off the jamb. " It 's too heavy for me to push alone. " He sat down on the porch. " I might as well stay here myself because John Washburn will never take me back if I do n't have the ball with me. " This moved his parents ; his father nodded at his mother, and they both stepped forward. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; on flat land their mother walked in front to slow its momentum. On the several down slopes, all three of them walked in front, leaning back into the ball to stall its progress, their shoulders pressed into the mold and pain and decay. When they reached the final hillside above the town, Abner and Louis and Lila paused by a cornfield. Below them the people sat on blankets on the plaza in front of the courthouse, eating the chicken and pork the girls brought around. On the wall of Elmer Woods 's store, the Democratic banner hung : " The party of the common man. " Across the courthouse steps, the Whigs banner : " Progress. " There John Washburn and Celia and Prudence smiled amiably at the crowd, sitting on top of their own enormous Harrison ball, on which someone had sewn a small American flag. John Washburn, seeing them, clapped his hands together and pointed. Soon, the entire crowd turned to look at them, pointing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caked in rocks and mud, a record not of people or pain but futility. " Here come your Democrats, " Abner yelled. " You can see what they are made of, now that they are here. " Below him, John Washburn clapped. Having said what he meant to say, Abner felt light again, incorporeal. He did not notice that his parents had taken his words about the arrival of the Democrats literally, that they had bent into the ball for a final push. " And now she is all yours, " his father said. They both grunted. As the ball passed him, Abner grabbed at it futilely, but the rag he caught - Frank Pool 's - pulled loose in his hand, and the ball sped on, bouncing over rocks, gathering speed as it ran the last of the hill. It bounded once, heavily, on the road and then rolled through the courthouse plaza at a slow and sickening pace. Smelling it, people scooped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead, into the streets of Pelton. Several people sneezed ; someone else coughed so loudly he seemed to be tearing his lungs. By the time the ball died at the courthouse steps, the plaza was empty. A door slammed shut at Elmer Woods 's store. Smoke began to puff from the chimneys of the houses in town. Celia and Prudence Washburn covered their noses with handkerchiefs. John Washburn raised his right arm to the dispersing crowd and said an empty, unheard plea, then sank down onto the steps, his head in his hands. Breathing in, Abner saw the words he might say, fragile as wings. Humiliated, John Washburn would never welcome him back. There was nothing for Abner in Pelton, or in words. He turned with a sigh up the hill toward home, and he thought he saw an inexplicable shadow of defeat in his parents " eyes, too, despite their obvious reasons for celebration, as they walked him back.
