1016041 I was raised in a small south Texas town, a one-Catholic-church town, Edcouch, Texas. As you entered Edcouch on Highway 107, the sign read " Entering Edcouch, Population 2,683. " One mile later it read " Leaving Edcouch, Population 2,683. " But I do n't think Edcouch really had that many people unless the sign took into account various farm animals and wandering pets. <p> I was no different from anyone else in Edcouch ; I was Mexican American, spoke Spanish, and was Catholic. The Catholic church in Edcouch was St. Theresa, and it was in this church that I served as an altar boy. <p> The priest, Father Horacio, loved me. I was his favorite altar boy, even though he once caught me and Joe Sanchez eating a bag of unblessed eucharist wafers.( Holy cookies, Joe and I liked to call them.) <p> I liked being an altar boy for two reasons. One, we were allowed to get out of school whenever Father Horacio had to perform services at a funeral, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two, every Sunday I got the chance to see just about everyone in Edcouch. Everyone except the " heathens, " whom I saw at the five o'clock mass. The ten o'clock mass, though, had the most people, including a couple of the high school cheerleaders, who had to stick out their soft pink tongues to receive the holy cookie. There I would stand, next to Father Horacio, with a small, round brass tray. When the girls would come up to accept the sacrament, they would close their eyes and stick out their pink tongues. What a sight that was! <p> St. Theresa had some interesting parishioners. There was the mayor, the fat mailman who did n't deliver letters( we only had post office boxes in Ericouch), the policeman and his alcoholic brother, a few volunteer firemen, Mr. and Mrs. Carson( who were really Methodists), and Mr. Garza, the owner of the panaderia. I liked most of the people who went to church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school bully, who lived in the worst part of Edcouch, el rincon del diablo( the devil 's corner), was as mean as Mr. Garza. <p> During the collection part of the mass each altar boy would take one side of the pews. We only had two rows of pews, so we could cover the whole church. I always walked down the middle of the church and took the right side and always, always had to put the collection basket before Mr. Garza, who never gave a cent. The poorest woman in town, Miss Alvarado, who always wore a worn-out red shawl and an old pair of leather sandals and who only had three front teeth, always gave something. Even Luis Luna gave something, though it was probably stolen lunch money, but hey! he gave. Anyway, Mr. Garza never gave. When I would put the collection basket in front of him, I would sometimes shake it a bit, but he would n't even flinch. This would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would tell all my friends what a " pinche vato " Mr. Garza was. <p> My mother, as well as everyone else in town, loved Mr. Garza 's panaderia, and she would send me down to Mr. Garza 's every other day to buy molletes, empanadas, and marranitos. I had to admit that Mr. Garza had great pan dulce : heart-shaped cookies qovered with sugar and cookies shaped like pigs were my favorites. <p> As I pulled open the screen door to the bakery, a little bell above the door would jingle. You had to make sure the door closed behind you because Mr. Garza did not like flies in his bakery, and I do n't think he liked me in his bakery either. Mr. Garza knew who I was ; he knew my parents, and he always talked to my grandparents, but he never had anything to say to me. <p> There he would stand behind the glass counter with his fat, hairy arms resting on the counter. On his fat wrist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his short, fat fingers. His hair was always slicked back and was as black as the thin, wormy looking mustache underneath his pug nose. <p> He would look down at me and ask in a low voice, " *( This character can not be represented in ASCII text) Que quieres esta manana? " I would look in the glass cabinet filled with brightly colored molletes : pink, yellow, brown, red, and white. There were nice, big, brown marranitos, heart-shaped cookies covered with sugar and pan dulce of all colors and shapes. I could feel my eyes dilating and my mouth watering. I would tell him what I wanted, pay him, and leave without saying any more than I had to. But I would make sure I was halfway home before I began eating the cookies because I did not want Mr. Garza to see me. <p> What probably made me the angriest was watching him drive by in his yellow Chevrolet Impala with his windows rolled up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eight-track tape player, a defroster, a heater, and an air conditioner, and they all worked. <p> One cold day after mass Father Horacio invited the altar boys to his house right next to the church for hot Mexican chocolate and pan dulce. It was an invitation we could n't refuse, and besides, you ca n't say no to a priest. <p> We were having a great time until I asked, knowing the answer, where he bought the cookies. <p> " What? I ca n't believe you bought the cookies from Mr. Garza 's panaderia, " I immediately said. Father looked a little puzzled. <p> " Why, David, you do n't like Mr. Garza 's cookies? " he asked in his priest-like voice. <p> " No, I like the cookies. It 's Mr. Garza I do n't like, and you should n't like him either. " <p> " Why do n't you like Mr. Garza, David? Has he done something to hurt you? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never gives money to the church. Whenever I put the basket in front of him, he just sits there. " <p> Father looked a little upset and I knew why. I knew better : God does n't care if you give money to the church or not, even if you are as rich as Mr. Garza. But instead of giving me the standard lecture, Father Horacio asked me to follow him to his office. I figured he was going to give me the lecture in his office instead of in front of the other altar boys. <p> Once we were inside his office, Father Horacio brought out a big, black book, one I had never seen before. It was full of names and I recognized all of them. They were parishioners of St. Theresa. Some of the names were in blue ink and others in red ink. Father pointed to Mr. Garza 's name, which was in blue ink, and on the same line, a couple of inches across, was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's how much Mr. Garza has given to St. Theresa over the past eight years, " Father said. " Do you know why he has given so much to the church? " <p> All I could do was shake my head -- no. <p> " Nine years ago Mr. Garza 's wife, Elena, became very ill and was dying. Mr. Garza and I prayed together all night for Elena. Mr. Garza made a promesa. Mr. Garza promised he would give the church fifty dollars a week for the rest of his life if God would let Elena live another year. Elena died four months after Mr. Garza made the promise. " <p> I could n't say anything. I felt terrible and asked Father to forgive me, but he said Mr. Garza was the one from whom I should ask forgiveness. After I found out about Mr. Garza 's donations, I stopped shaking the collection basket in front of him, and I would n't say mean things about him to anyone. But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought. Weeks passed and months went by and then years, but I could not bring myself to apologize. Oh, I tried a couple of times, but I just could n't. <p> Mr. Garza died three years ago, and marranitos and heart-shaped sugar cookies have never tasted the same. <p>
