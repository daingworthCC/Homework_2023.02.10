1008341 Love Is a Map I Must Not Set on Fire <p> When I take you in flurries the lights go out. <p> Stars come out. You come out again. <p> Love is under the bed, a children 's monster. <p> The dildo gleams. We hold knives in our hands. <p> When I take you in words we reinvent categories. <p> Chair is a particular type of chair. <p> There are no abstractions, we are all specifics. <p> The window gleams, awash with stars. <p> When I take you home all hardwood is sacred. <p> The things we buy represent nothing but use. <p> Kiwis gleam ; we light them as candles. <p> The dildo emerges from the dishwasher in time. <p> When I take you with wind beneath terrible branches <p> you whirl your skirts to make up for lost time. <p> You become weather and I am your weatherman. <p> I point to the map I must not set on fire. <p> When I take you in marriage old laws turn to tangles. <p> You toss your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie we say monster, a verb in the making. <p> I must not commit arson. All gleaming is gone. <p>
