1005341 Starring Casee Buck! I could see my name in lights. " Mom, can you believe it? " I said, waving the letter. " They picked me to be one of the kids in the new play at the Arts Center. " <p> Mom was happy, too, until she read the letter more closely. " But, Casee, " she said, " I do n't have time to drive you all the way to the city every night for play practice. " <p> " I 'll find the time for you, " I told her. Nobody ever got to be a star by letting a little thing like time stop her. <p> I headed straight for the library. Mrs. Garcia, the reference librarian, always had the answers to tough questions. <p> " Follow me, " she said, leading the way to a rack of audiotapes. " Here 's just what you need. The Secrets of Time Management on six cassettes. " <p> I looked at the back of the box Mrs. Garcia handed me. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had, " ' I read. " Perfect! " <p> But when I showed the tapes to Mom, she said, " If I had time to listen to six cassettes, I would n't need to know the secrets of time management. " <p> " I 'll listen for you, " I said. I knew the tapes would help me find those two hours a day that Mom never knew she had. While I washed the dishes, I listened to one side of Time Management. It did n't take long to put what I learned into practice. The phone rang. <p> " I 'm sorry, " I said, " Mom 's unavailable at the moment. " I sounded exactly like the secretary on the Time Management tape. " May I take a message? " <p> " Who was that? " Mom asked when I got off the phone. " Grandma. " <p> " You told my own mother I was unavailable? " <p> " A good secretary is supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " Time management. " <p> The next morning I came to the breakfast table with a notebook and a pencil. " OK, Mom, " I said. " Let 's start on your list. " <p> " What list? " Mom mumbled crunching on her granola. <p> " Your list of priorities. " <p> " Where 'd you learn a big word like that? " <p> " You know, " I said. <p> " Oh. Time management. " Mom made a face as if she had just found a frog in her granola. <p> " Mom, " I said, " how do you ever expect to find two hours a day if you do n't have priorities? " Ok, Ok. " <p> " Now, " I said in my most businesslike voice, " what things do you have to get done today? " <p> " Go to work, buy groceries, correct papers, exercise, take the cato get his teeth cleaned, return a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish that sweater for Grandma 's birthday.... " <p> I scribbled as fast as I could. " Which are your priorities? " <p> " All of them, Mom said. " Oh and there 's one more thing, " she added, raising her eyebrows at me. " Return that call from my mother. " <p> " Mom you ca n't possibly do all those things today. You 've got to delegate. <p> Me and my big mouth. All at once I remebered what delegate meant. Get somebody else to do it. And I was the only " somebody else " here. <p> And that 's how I came to be folding laundry at 8:15 PM. while listening to tape four of Time Management. <p> IMG
