TVs became part of American life after World War If( 1941-45). <p> > Philo Farnsworth, 22, holds a key part of his invention. It is 1928, seven years after he got the idea for TV during his first year in high school. <p> A 14-year-old farm boy got the idea for television while plowing a field. Then he set out to make his idea happen. <p> Characters <p> Narrators 1, 2-people who tell the story <p> Mrs. Farnsworth -- Philo 's mother <p> Mr. Farnsworth-Philo 's father <p> Philo Farnsworth-inventor <p> Justin Toan -- high school teacher <p> Elma " Pem " Gardner-Cliffs sister, <p> Philo 's wife <p> Cliff Gardner-Philo 's friend <p> George Everson-salesman <p> Jess McCracken -- banker <p> David Sarnoff-head of RCA <p> Andrew Case -- RCA 's lawyer <p> David Lippincott-Philo 's lawyer <p> Narrator 1 : In 1919, after a trip in wagons pulled by horses, the Farnsworths reach their new farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, all I see is a bunch of broken-down buildings. <p> Mr. Farnsworth : Serena, someday we 'll have a fine farm here. <p> Narrator 2 : One member of the family, Philo, 13, is excited by what he sees. <p> Philo Farnsworth : Father? Are those wires running between the buildings? <p> Mr. Farnsworth : Yes, Son. <p> Philo : That means we 've got electricity! <p> Narrator 1 : In a few weeks, Philo is the family expert on the electrical system. <p> Mr. Farnsworth : Philo, the machine that makes electricity is broken. Can you fix it? <p> Philo : The generator? Sure. Just let me finish making this motor as a surprise for Mother. I 'm going to put it on her washing machine, so she wo n't have to crank the machine by hand anymore. <p> Narrator 2 : In 1920, Philo begins high school. He takes a senior science class. <p> Narrator 1 : But the course is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, agrees to hold a special class after school for Philo. <p> Narrator 2 : One night Philo, reads a headline in a science magazine. It says, " Pictures That Fly Through the Air. " <p> Philo :( to himself) Hmmm. I wonder how someone could make pictures Ity like that? <p> Narrator 1 : In the spring of 1921, Philo, 14, walks behind a horse-drawn plow. The plow digs rows of straight lines across the flat field. The lines give him an idea. <p> Philo :( to himself) What if I could trap light in a glass jar and then break the light into tiny lines of electricity? Then I could make pictures that fly through the air! <p> Narrator 2 : The next day after school, Mr. Tolman sees Philo at the chalkboard. Justin Tolman : What are you drawing? <p> Philo :( smiling) Electronic television. <p> Tolman : Television? What 's that? <p> Narrator 1 : Philo, explains his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work! <p> Narrator 2 : In three years, Philo 's father dies.

I 'm interested in radios too. <p> Narrator 2 : Phil@ begins dating Pern. <p> Narrator 1 : One night Philo shares his television idea with Cliff and Pem. A salesman, George Everson, sits nearby. Cliff : You 'd break a picture into electricity and send it though the air. Wow! <p> Pem : That 's kind of how radio workssound is broken into waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes. But electronic television will have light and sound. George Everson : Excuse me, young man. What was it you were speaking of? <p> Philo : It 's my idea for television. George : Tella-what? <p> Narrator 2 : Philo explains his idea. <p> George : How much money do you think it would take to make the te-television? <p> Philo : I think about $6,000. <p> George : I can get my hands on almost that much. I can get the rest from an old friend, Jess McCracken. He runs a bank. <p> Philo : That would be a dream come true. <p> George : There 's one catch. Jess lives in California. So do I. We 'd want you to move there, so we could check in with you. <p> Narrator 1 : Philo, 19, and Pern, 18, get married. With Cliff, they go to California. <p> Narrator 2 : On January 7, 1927, Philo sends drawings of his television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Narrator 1 : A patent is a written paper that says the inventor is the only person who can make, use, or sell an idea. <p> Cliff : People who use his idea must pay. Pem : Is n't that payment called a royalty? <p> Cliff : Yes. And it could add up to millions! <p> Narrator 2 : Making the television is slow work. To build it parts for it, Philo and. Cliff must first make special tools. <p> Narrator 1 : After work, they meet Pem. <p> Pem : How did it go in the lab today? <p> Philo : We learned about glassblowing. <p> Cliff : So we can make the image breaker. <p> Pem : What 's that? <p> Cliff : A glass tube that changes what the camera sees into electrical signals. <p> Pem : What happens to the signals? <p> Philo : They pass through the tube and across a flat surface-the picture screen. <p> Narrator 2 : In late 1927, Everson and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 've been patient with you boys. Now show me what we paid for. <p> Philo : Cliff, turn on the camera! <p> Narrator 1 : In another room, Cliff points the camera at a sign drawn in black ink. <p> George :( looking at the television screen) There 's a sign on the screen! <p> Philo : A sign any banker should know. <p> Jess : It-it 's a dollar sign! <p> Philo : There you have it-electronic television, the radio of tomorrow. <p> Jess : Great work, Farnsworth, We 'll sell the rights to RCA, the huge electronic company, and become rich men. <p> Philo : I have no plans to sell the rights, sir. <p> George : But it 's going to take a big company like RCA to make televisions. <p> Philo : Then RCA can pay us royalties. I 'd rather own my work than get rich. <p> Narrator 2 : Unable to agree with Jess and George, Philo, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Pennsylvania. <p> Narrator 1 : Other people give Philo money to make his invention work better. Word of Philo 's work reaches RCA 's head, <p> David Sarnoff : in New York City. Sarnoff talks to RCA 's chief lawyer. <p> David Sarnoff : I want RCA to build televisions right now, Case. <p> Andrew Case : Then we 'll have to pay royalties to Farnsworth. His image breaker is the only way to turn light into electricity. <p> Sarnoff : Nuts! Our Mr. Zworykin had the idea in 1923, before Farnsworth did. <p> Narrator 2 : Philo goes to court to prove that he had the idea for television first. In court, Case questions Sarnoff. <p> Case : And you say that Mr. Zworykin had the idea for television first? <p> Sarnoff : He asked for a patent in 1923 for his image breaker, the iconoscope. Narrator 1 : David Lippincott, Philo 's lawyer, questions Sarnoff. <p> David Lippincott : Did the government grant a patent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes. <p> Lippincott : Actually, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the United States granted no patent to Zworykin. That 's because no one could build an iconoscope that worked! <p> Narrator 2 : Philo takes the stand. <p> Case : You say that you had the idea for. television in 1921, sir? <p> Philo : Yes, while I was plowing a field. <p> Case : But in 1921 you were only 14! <p> Narrator 1 : Lippincott calls a witness. <p> Lippincott : I call Justin Tolman, Mr. Farnsworth 's former teacher. <p> Lippincott : You taught Philo Farnsworth? <p> Tolman : The smartest student I ever had. <p> Lippincott : And did he first develop the idea for television when he was 14? Tolman : Yes, and I have proof. <p> Narrator 1 : Tolman pulls out a yellowed piece of paper. On it is a sketch of Philo 's original idea. The sketch is dated 1921. <p> Tolman : I copied his drawing. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a genius! <p> Narrator 2 : Farnsworth won the case. RCA had to pay him royalties. <p> Narrator 1 : Philo never liked what big companies did with hts invention. <p> Narrator 2 : Yet in 1969, two years before he died, he and Pern watched pictures on TV of men walking on the moon. <p> Philo : Pern, those pictures make it all worthwhile. <p> - by Scott Ingram <p> Think About It <p> Why did Philo work so hard and so long to make his dream come true? What goal could you spend years working toward? <p> TV made the world seem smaller. In 1953, New Yorkers stop to watch Queen Elizabeth B on IV. Hours earlier, she had been crowned in London, England. <p>
