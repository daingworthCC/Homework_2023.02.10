1003041 I am in the lurching little bathroom as the train pulls into Victoria Station. I 'm checking to see if I look O.K., if he 'll think I 'm too much older. I grab my things and jump off, and there he is, eyes rolled up to the high Victorian ceiling, with his funny sly-shy smile. His cheeks are English-rosy, and he 's wearing a rainbow striped sweater, another set of stripes in a stocking cap on his head, and nice pale blue jeans. Thin as ever. Not a bit older he looks. A little more colorful. <p> Oh, what a hug, a delicious hug. There 's his whimsical voice again, always sexy, always witty, and pitched almost too low for my hearing. " Here you are, " he says. " It 's quite disconcerting -- here you are after all that time. " Well, that is n't witty, but it 's said with a little leer, you see, and a bit of whimsy. <p> We 're in his little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. <p> " Do you mind if we stop at a bottle bank? " he asks me. <p> " Of course not, " I say. " What 's a bottle bank? " <p> " It 's a place to leave your empty bottles. I 've boxes of them in back. " I look in the backseat. All wine bottles. At the first bottle bank, we climb out of the Mini and each carry a box of bottles, but there 's no room to put them, it 's all overflowed because last night was New Year 's Eve, I forgot to tell you. A lot of broken glass lying around the bottle bank. <p> " Let 's try another one, do you mind? " he says. He gives my knee a squeeze as we go swinging around a corner. " Ever so nice to see you, " he says, raising his lovely, funny arched eyebrows. " I quite fancy you all over again. " <p> " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After all it 's what I came for. Our agreement was to be a bit cautious -- no obligation to sleep together if the feeling is n't there after six years apart. But it was always there before, why not now? It 's half my reason for coming here. Two years after my last love left me I still have n't recovered. The thought of sleeping with Wendell is a last-ditch hope and consolation, a New Year 's Eve flight into Auld Lang Syne. <p> " Here 's another. " We pull up to another collection of bottles on a curbside with a sort of shelter over it. This time at least there 's not the broken glass in such abundance. We squeeze Wendell 's boxes into the area, and off we go. " Awful thing to do to you when you have jet lag, " he says. <p> " But now I 'll drive you around a bit before we go home. I thought we could walk along the Thames a bit, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is simply sparkling, the Thames. There 's a beautiful bridge, there are the Houses of Parliament. There seem to be banners everywhere. Birds are flying. It 's the first day of the new year. Wendell is smiling his funny arch smile at me, he 's holding my hand, my cape is flying about behind me. Oh, what lovely energy, what a new, crisp, delightful, sensuous life. <p> Was it then that I threw my handbag into the air, credit cards, travelers ' checks, identity and all? Oh, bright Thames, here take my identity! Wheeee! I 'm going to make love again, it 's going to be loveleeeee! <p> " Oh, dear, " says Wendell. " You 're so swathed in that cape, I never noticed you had a bag anyway. You always were a bit unreliable, " he says. " But let 's go back to the bottle banks, maybe it 's there. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bottle banks, back to Victoria, no it is n't anywhere. <p> " Never mind, " I say. <p> " Never mind, " he says. " You have no identity, you 're in my power. " Yes, his house is still next to the mental hospital, still next to the abandoned agricultural hall. But nicened up a bit all around. Just like last time, we race up the stairs together. What a fool. I have to make all those phone calls and feel such an idiot. And he does look annoyed and say in his soft voice worried things about me. " Oh, dear, you have n't changed, have you " But then he kisses me on the bed a bit, and we begin to discover one another all over again, laughing and desiring all at once. He runs a bubble bath and both of us get in. Oh, porpoise-like, oh, porpoise in the Thames, how are you? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nerve, the joie de vivre? My children have all gone away to college. My most recent attempt at love has ended in -- once again! -- my love 's leaving me for a woman exactly ten years younger than me. Lonely, sad, and feeling restless, I answered a letter from Wendell, who has been my friend and lover off and on for a dozen years. We met as actors in a play at Williamstown years ago. We seemed to be so perfectly attuned to one another -- a kind of instinctive harmony, I thought at the time. The relationship lasted throughout the next year, and I was just on the verge of thinking it might be important, and that maybe it was even mutual -- when he told me one weekend that he 'd just married another woman, someone he knew in England. " I do n't know how it happened, " he said apologetically. " It just came over us, somehow. " We stayed friends, though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, even visited them in London a few years ago. <p> So when Wendell wrote to say that his marriage was over, I responded to the enticement of beautifully written, witty letters, which began crossing the Atlantic more and more frequently. At last I was the one to make the bold suggestion : " Shall I come visit you in London during my winter break? " I wrote. <p> " That would be lovely! " came the postcard response. <p> But when I telephoned about the dates for my plane flights, a woman answered. " Oh, yes! " she said cordially. " I 'll give him the message. " When Wendell called back, I asked about the woman on the phone. " You 're not living with someone, are you? " I asked carefully, holding my breath. <p> " Oh, no! Harriet and her little girl just rent a room from me. They needed a place in a hurry, and I took pity on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice, " I said. " She sounded very nice on the phone. " <p> Tell me about your lodger, " I say now, over tea. " She really does n't mind my being here? " <p> " Why should she? " he says. " We 're careful of one another 's feelings -- but we have no agreement. " <p> " What do you mean, careful of one another 's feelings? " <p> " You see, normally I would n't bring someone home and she would n't either -- but I 've explained about you, and she understands. " <p> I 'm wishing I 'd asked him more questions from the other side of the Atlantic. Perhaps I 'd been afraid to. " So she is more than just a lodger? " <p> " There 's no difficulty at all, " he says. " She wo n't even be here for several days. She 's on holiday. " <p> Oh, well, then. Never mind, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " woman with no identity. Come back to my boudoir. " <p> " Before dinner? " I say. But I love the idea. It 's the best, the very best way to deal with jet lag. <p> But there is another side to this story, one that does n't seem to fit, that makes it all a paradox. I have n't come here just to see Wendell. My beloved friend Mira Bai is also in London. She is here with our yoga teacher, well, I might as well say it, our guru, a brilliant Indian physician who gave up his practice to teach yoga to a growing flock of disciples. Dr. Shanta had a stroke last year and has come to London for speech therapy at a famous clinic. Wendell, of course, has no interest in seeing Mira or Guruji, so we will have a nice separation in our days, as I leave him to his usual projects -- scripts, rehearsals, negotiations -- and make my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entourage are staying. <p> So here I am in London, creating for myself exactly the same division I felt a dozen years ago, when I did n't marry Wendell. Well, not that I 'm sure I would have, but I just did n't think of it at the time, and later he said that he 'd just as soon have married me as Linda, the woman he married so suddenly that weekend. If only I had seemed to be interested, he said. Even with my children, he said. He quite liked them. For years afterward, I wished that I had known that. He probably did n't even mean it, but it haunted me sometimes -- how much nicer our lives might have been, the children 's and mine. Maybe his would have been harder, maybe he made the right choice. But we -- we would have had his funny whimsical smile, his love of good cooking and country walks, his mild, clear boundaries between what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyway, it did n't happen. <p> And the same thing distracts me now that distracted me then -- my spiritual connection. In those days it was much more intense than it is now, now that I 'm older and have that something called perspective. Then, I was sure I had found the spiritual family, the ideology, that comforted me, gave meaning to my life, and if it was good for me, I was sure that meant it would be good for my children too. I would drag my children to the ashram on weekends and vacations, where we would spend the money we needed for shoes and school clothes, to be part of a community that did n't find us freakish( single mothers were that rare in our town in those days). Our dear friend Peg would be there too happily urging us to use her new Sanskrit name, Mira Bai. I remember the first night we stayed over There was joyous Sanskrit chanting and Mira beaming with love for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us The children seemed as enchanted as I, with the candlelight, the music the lively, kindly dark face of Guruji at the center of it all. <p> With such inducements, such total embrace of our incomplete family such a place to run to -- how could I take mild and whimsical Wendell seriously? And yet no spiritual comfort would quite match the pleasure of being in bed with him. So I kept the two worlds separate -- sleeping with Wendell when he showed up, flying kites, making jams with him and the children, imposing sprouts and salads, tofu and high-minded blessings on him. No wonder he was exasperated -- the tofu and the blessings were especially not his style -- and found someone else. I felt the loss, felt a little betrayed, but went back to the ashram for another weekend, immersed myself in spirituality, and found it fairly easy to let go. <p> Now, a dozen years later, he 's single again, but there 's a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he let on in our transatlantic phone calls. And my guru and Mira, my oldest spiritual friend, are living with a small group of devotees in a tiny apartment in Belsize Park. I have rushed across the Atlantic to find myself and, once again, I find myself split in two. When Wendell leaves for rehearsal in the morning, I get on the tube for Belsize Park, walk up the shabbily genteel high street, stopping at a little florist 's shop to buy some freesias, and make my way past the Royal Free Hospital, where Guruji goes each day for post-stroke speech therapy, to the decaying corner building where they live -- Guruji, Mira, and two young devotees. I bang on the door with my gloved fist. " Mittened on it manfully, " I quote Dylan Thomas to myself. At first I pushed the doorbell buttons, but clearly they do n't work. The door, though shabby with several peeling colors of paint, with a couple of empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sturdy. Though I pound and pound on it, nobody hears me. Just as I am halfway down the path to the street, looking for a phone booth to call them from, the door opens. A round old Indian man with a gray topknot on his head and a big, gap-toothed grin lets me into the building. " Thank you, " I say. " I 'm here to see Dr. Shanta. " <p> " Yes, yes, " he nods happily. " Up there! " <p> I thank him again, and walk across the torn linoleum of the ground-floor hallway, then up the two flights to their floor. <p> I rap gently on the door, then push it open, for it is n't latched. Mira Bai looks up at me heavy-lidded, still deep in meditation. Her silver-gray hair curls in wisps and tendrils around her face, and is gathered in a barrette at the back of the neck. Her orange cotton sari curves and crumples around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face, though etched with many lines, is like a sleepy angel 's. I have seen her like this a hundred times or more. Always it is a little frightening to see how deep she goes, what tidal mysteries sweep her away again and again. She sits cross-legged in an armchair that is shoved up next to the kitchen door. Every bit of space in the room is taken up with some kind of bulky object. On the other side of the kitchen doorway is the chair where Guruji sits, and next to it a little table with an orange cloth over it. In front of his chair a small electric heater is buzzing away. Beneath the window, on a piece of wood over two cinder blocks, is a little altar, cluttered with pictures, flowers in various stages of freshness and decay, crystals and incense burners and beads, and a variety of odd mementos. At the other end of the room, there is a bed for one of the devotees, her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battered condition, which contains the clothing of all four of them who live here. Next to the entrance door, opposite the window wall, is another mattress covered in an Indian print spread, and yet another private altar, this one with dozens of pictures of Guruji on it. Among all these things are yet two more shabby armchairs, another end table, and an old leather hassock. <p> How much more crowded it must be when all of them are here! But am lucky this morning, because the others are at the hospital for Guruji 's speech therapy. Mira is alone in her meditation. I am gazing on he heavy eyes with pain and love. <p> " Why did n't you come sooner? she says. " We could have had all this time alone for talking. " Yet she can hardly talk. <p> " I was banging on the door for a good ten minutes, " I say. " But nobody heard me. " <p> " Ah, " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unlock it for you. Still, I was expecting you half an hour ago! " <p> " I know. I 'm sorry. It took me longer than I thought to find my way. " <p> " I 'm so happy you 're here, " she says. " I want to show you all of London, I 'm in love with the churches. We 'll go to St. Martin-in-the-Fields, we 'll go to St. Paul 's. " <p> " Churches? " I say, surprised. <p> " Sacred places are all the same, " she says. " They all have that holy vibration. Besides, I have been very drawn to Christian images lately, to the Virgin especially. I 'll tell you about it. " <p> " Where shall we go today? " I ask her. " I have n't much money -- I lost my purse in my first hour here! It 's crazy, but I do n't even worry about it, I feel so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be returned to you, " she says decisively. " You 'll see. " She stands up a little unsteadily, giving her sari a little shake to uncrumple it, then looks up at me with a smile. I laugh, reaching out my hand to steady her. " Well, I do n't deserve it, " I say. <p> " Yes, you do. " She grins at me with that sweet old sparkle in her pale blue eyes, with the left pupil smaller than the right because of a car accident from long ago. She puts her arms around me in a great motherly hug, and I feel as always, deeply comforted. But she is so thin, I feel that too. " Mira! You 're not eating enough! " <p> " Oh, we 're on a small budget here, the four of us, " she says. " But we get along all right. " <p> " But are you really eating your share? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment, " she says, " and then there is n't anything left later on. " <p> " They ought to save something for you, " I say. <p> " Oh, they try, " she laughs. " I do believe they try! It 's hard, though, I admit it -- hard to be cooped up with Lakshmi and Kamala in this tiny apartment. " <p> I am looking around the cluttered, colorful space, trying to imagine how three more bodies could fit inside it, when we hear their footfalls on the stairs. <p> As the door opens, Lakshmi and Kamala, two devotees I know from the ashram, come in with Guruji. The two of them seem so much alike at first glance, both with long, uncombed blond hair, both in white saris. Lakshmi is first, holding the door open for Guruji, while Kamala is stooping at his side, helping him remove his black cotton Chinese slippers. <p> " Ohhhhhh! " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. His dark eyes are bright with welcome and surprise. He mumbles a bit, some effort at a welcoming phrase, but the words do n't come out. He is a small man in stature, but his face is almost lionlike in its strength, its bristling brows, the dark gleam of his eyes-and yet full of kindness. Since his stroke he has not been able to shave, and has grown a dark gray beard that makes him seem more like an ancient swami, with his orange robes and the orange tam-o ' -shanter on his head. <p> We are standing there in a kind of silent, dazzling greeting, as Kamala whisks his coat away and Lakshmi begins clucking about whether there will be enough food for lunch, then interrupts herself. " Oh, I do n't mean to be rude, " she says. " It 's so nice to see you, Claudia. But I am just thinking, how will we make plans for lunch... " <p> " Oh, no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going out -- are n't we, Mira? " <p> " If you do n't mind, Guruji, " she says, and he smiles and waves his hand as if to waft us immediately into a delightful adventure. <p> Suddenly I remember my freesias, still not in water, and quickly pick them up from Mira 's prayer mat and hand them to Guruji. He breathes in their rich scent, saying " Ohhhhhh! " again, in that wonderful way. <p> " It 's wonderful to see you, Guruji! " I say, as Mira pulls her coat from the big wardrobe and comes smiling toward us, ready to show me London. <p> In the evening, I say goodbye to Mira as she gets on the train to Belsize Park, and then head back to Wendell 's house for dinner. His newly remodeled kitchen is in the basement, just as the original kitchen was a hundred years ago. Heavy beams above us, with an array of well-used pots and skillets hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the room, where I am cutting up tomatoes for the salad. He is cooking for me one of his near-Eastern specialties, a spicy couscous with eggplant and chickpeas. He smiles at me happily. " Is n't this lovely " he says. " Like old times! " <p> The days and nights pass quickly this way, and I am ever dizzier and more divided, making love with Wendell, then wandering about with Mira Bai and meditating in Belsize Park. But now the lodger has come back, with her little girl. Did I tell you there 's a little girl? We are in the old-fashioned basement kitchen where we have all just met. Heather, the child, is a spunky, modern little thing with a spiky, elfin haircut. " Where are you going to sleep? " she says in her clipped, perfect British child way. <p> " Oh, I do n't know, " I say. I look at Harriet, her mother, who is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, slim, and sparkling. Our eyes meet almost laughingly, then skid away. <p> " But you must sleep somewhere, " says Heather. " Where will Wendell put you? " <p> Wendell 's shoulders look a bit hunched as he turns away, fiddles with a wine cork. <p> " Well, I expect he 'll put you in the bathroom, " Heather says. " He often puts people there. " <p> So that 's settled. I 'll sleep in the bathroom. Wendell pours us some wine, and we all drink up. To the New Year. " And to Claudia 's luck, " toasts Wendell. " Her entire handbag was returned to the embassy, can you imagine? " <p> " Lovely, " says Harriet, and lifts her glass to me. " I 'm so glad. " <p> I ask what it 's like being a midwife. " I love working with women, " she says. " I love giving them the support and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing babies into the world. " <p> I tell her about my women playwrights class, promise to send her my copy of an American feminist book about midwives. Wendell relaxes. It 's obvious we like each other. <p> The phone rings, and Wendell takes it in his study, leaving us alone for a while. We get on splendidly. We do like each other, even more when he 's out of the room. Given time we 'd tell each other everything. After all, we 're both feminists and believe in sisterhood. <p> It 's obvious that she loves him. Obvious he does n't deserve it. But maybe I only imagine it. <p> Do you think I only imagine it? " I ask Mira, as we sip tea in the National Gallery 's cafeteria -- a respite, where we can look not at the walls, but at the people around us, sometimes dutiful, sometimes passionate, art-seeking people. It 's easy to spot the art students, clothed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their portfolios and folded easels propped against their chairs. I watch them distractedly, thinking not of art, but of love triangles, of passion, or lust anyway, and betrayal, or at least deception. What a comfort to be here with Mira! <p> " It 's been so long since I 've been in that life, " she laughs, chuckles really, in that funny, almost sensuous way of hers. <p> " But remember that time a million years ago, " I say, leaning forward, wishing for that old Mira. " When you confessed to me how many lovers you 'd had, and I confessed to you that I 'd had no one but my ex-husband? " <p> " Oh, how we depressed ourselves that night, " she says. " And really it was all the same thing, was n't it? My dozen and your one, they gave us both such terrible sadness! " <p> " And I suppose you think that 's all I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No, I only wonder why you bother with him at all! I wish there were room for you in our apartment, it 's no place for you to be, that situation. " <p> " You 're right, " I say. " You 've always understood things when I was baffled. But how can I change things now? My return flight 's just a few days away. I 'll have to stick it out. " " If you need to borrow money for a hotel... " she begins, but I hush her, for I know she has even less money than I do. <p> " Let 's go see some paintings, " I urge. <p> " There 's a special one I want to show you, " she agrees. <p> We rush past masterpieces with hardly a glance, as she leads us to the painting. <p> " Here, " she says finally. She sinks to the floor in front of it, gazing upward. The look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what to do. Wo n't a guard make her stand up? But I sink to the floor beside her. " Leonardo da Vinci, " she says softly, " ' The Virgin of the Rocks. ' Look! " <p> " How dark, how strange! " I exclaim. I have never seen such a Madonna. She is in a stark landscape, a bit of surf in the upper left corner, amidst tall rock formations. The Virgin and child, with his cousin the infant St. John and a serene, sisterly angel, sit in the foreground in a dark grotto, surrounded by great rocks, almost a Stonehenge by the sea. The Virgin 's robe is darkest blue, and the only light is in their faces, the children 's bodies, and a few small white flowers beneath them. <p> " That 's my grandmother 's brooch, " Mira says. " I used to wear it all the time, remember? " <p> For the first time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloak. " I 'd forgotten it, " I say. <p> " But you see the resemblance, do n't you? " says Mira. <p> " To your grandmother 's brooch? " <p> " To me, " she says. " Do n't you see it? " Her voice is different, not my bantering Mira 's voice but something different that chills me. " I have n't told you this before, but an Indian psychic visited us last month -- and he told me I am a reincarnation of Mary. " <p> " But Mira, you did n't believe him? " <p> " Not at first, " she says. " Guruji dismissed it, but I think it was a kind of jealousy on his part, for the psychic had a great spiritual power, and urged me to leave Guruji and follow him. " <p> " Not at first... " I repeat. <p> " I do n't expect you to understand right away, " she says. " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paintings. The Pieta -- it was the time my brother died, in that accident years ago, and I was holding him in my lap, waiting for the ambulance. I 've lived the Pieta a thousand different ways and Gary 's dying was only the most recent. " <p> " Oh, Mira, it 's been too hard for you here, Guruji 's stroke, and all the crowding in that little apartment. " <p> " Just look at her, " Mira says. <p> " Look at the pain and mystery of all those rocks, look at the darkness. But I could always dive from rocks like that, dive right into the surf and swim like a seal! " <p> " But the Virgin does n't look like a swimmer, " I say. <p> " She was, though, " Mira says. " I was always a great swimmer -- and no one could beat me at high diving. " <p> What must I do? Ask her to come home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do? But in my mind 's eye, I am simply seeing Mira dive again, at a deep waterfall pool in the Catskills, skinny-dipping with her sisters and cousins. It was the first time I 'd ever been skinny-dipping, and that was plunge enough for me. How I admired Mira, the perfect arc of her lean body plunging so surely past the waterfall, into the dark pool. <p> In the evening I join Mira and the others at a meditation in Belsize Park. The owner of their building, the elderly Indian who let me in the first day, has built a big temple in his basement, covered the floor in carpets and cushions for people to sit cross-legged in meditation, and built a huge stage full of statues in the front. I have never seen such a garish assortment of religious objects, brightly colored divinities of every description, four-armed goddesses with swords, Hanuman the monkey god, Ganesha with his elephant head -- all made of plaster, and vividly painted or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinsel and strings of colored lights, mingling with candles and incense. In the midst of all this sits Guruji, whose teaching attracted me because of its simplicity, its intelligence, its compassion ; he seems out of place in this sideshow of colors and images. His small, brilliant-orange figure is seated on a blue cushion. His deep black eyes shine with life and humor and kindness, and it is a joy to be in the front row, even in this strange place, and find him smiling at me affectionately. Mira sits near him dreamily playing the harmonium for a woman from the Indian community, who is singing a devotional song, high-pitched, passionate, and complex. <p> What kind of spiritual ricochet bounced Mira from all this to the Virgin of the Rocks? Perhaps this cartoonish basement temple was just too big a shock, too big a change for her. Yet even here, the Indian goddesses are more appealing to strong women than the Virgin Mary, are n't they, with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lotuses, their lions underfoot? For years, even before we began to study yoga, Mira was a kind of goddess to me. She was a divorced single mother ahead of me, and when my husband left me for one of his students, she helped me through the pain, she showed me that it was possible to carry on with dignity, and to find my own way just as she had. Strangely, I was the one who found yoga and introduced her to Guruji -- but she was the one who dived in headfirst, gave up her career, gave her children to their father, so she could spend all her time as his disciple. <p> After the song, Guruji leads a meditation by chanting Ommmmm. And then one of his disciples plays a tape of an old meditation, from before the stroke that took away his power of speech. " Deeeeply relax your body, " says the beloved voice from the past. " Ohhhcean of vibration. Feel it, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. You are like the blue sky, " he says sweetly, and I forget that it is only a tape, and that the Guruji in front of me can no longer speak. I forget that Mira thinks she is the Virgin Mary, and I forget the jumble of vivid statues behind them. My eyes are closed, and I am like the blue sky. <p> How is your friend Mira? " asks Wendell, as we walk back to his house from the tube station late at night. The air is damp and misty, and the high street is a grayness, with pockets of harsh lighting and occasional neon. We have passed a group of rough young men with shaven heads, and heard the sound of bottles breaking, tossed against a wall for fun. <p> " I think she may be going crazy, " I say. This is my world-self talking. <p> " But you 've known that all along, have n't you? " he says. " Leading this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " But that 's only crazy the way I am, " I say. " It 's just a more extreme case of -- inspiration. " Another round of the popping sound of bottles breaking a block or so behind us. <p> " Ah, so what is different now? " he says, smiling at me, striding along quite at home in his north London world. <p> " Oh. Nothing, I guess. It 's just different. " <p> " Maybe you 're growing wiser, " he says. But I know that is n't true, not the way he means it, not any way at all, in fact. <p> This morning, after intimacies that seemed to me both passionate and tender, Wendell goes to bathe in the big bathroom next to the room we sleep in, on the top floor. In a few minutes I hear Harriet 's voice too. I hear the soft swirling sound as she slides into the bath with him. I hear their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sloshing of bathwater. When she has gone downstairs and he is in the bedroom again, pulling on his pants, I protest. " It 's rude, it 's hurtful, it makes me feel terrible, " I say. " You told me there was nothing between you. " <p> " I did n't quite say that, " says Wendell. " You may have misinterpreted a bit. " <p> " I want to leave right now, " I say. <p> " You must n't leave, " he says. " We 'll have such a lovely time this weekend. I 'm looking forward to it. " <p> " She must be miserable having me here, " I say. " If you 're that close, then how must she feel, having me sleep up here with you? " <p> " We 're not that close, " he says. " We have an arrangement, we 're both just alike that way, we have lots of friends. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three of us are together, and it 's not just me. I know it 's hard for her. " Then I begin to feel angry at her too, for sharing that bath with Wendell. It was clever, though, it makes things clear. " But at least she does n't have to hear us, " I say. " We do n't make love on the other side of her room, she does n't have to listen to us. It was rude of you to do that just now! " <p> " So it all comes down to manners, does it? You sound quite British, " he smiles. His clothes are all on now. None of mine are. I have been too hurt and angry to bother dressing. He sits down beside me. " I 'm sorry, " he says. " I did n't mean for it to be hard for anyone. I just really wanted to see you. " <p> All the way to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humiliation and the basement temple in Belsize Park. My life seems lost somewhere between them -- and no hope of being miraculously returned, the way my handbag was. In the old days, Mira and I shared everything, told each other everything. But how can I tell a Leonardo Madonna about my shameful situation, the noises in the bath on the other side of the bedroom wall? No more than I can tell Wendell about Mira and the Virgin. <p> There she is, easy to find in the midst of the rush hour crowd. She stands tall, with an orange scarf over her soft gray hair, and her orange sari hanging beneath a battered car coat. <p> " You 're late, " she tells me. " We 'll just barely catch the train! " As always, I run behind her, down the platform to the train for Cambridge. We laugh as we climb aboard, and find window seats facing each other. <p> " What fun! " I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm so glad you 've come, " she exclaims, an extra light in her pale blue eyes with the uneven pupils. " I have n't been to Cambridge in twenty years. My grandfather went there -- Queen 's College. I hope it has n't changed too much! " <p> Soon we are walking across the lawn to Queen 's College, the warm patina of the stone, the glitter of old windows in the wintry sun. The students are still away for the winter break, and most of the doors are locked. Under a stone arcade, we find a brightly lit office, and go in to ask for a key. <p> " My grandfather studied here, " Mira explains. I realize suddenly how odd she looks in her thick hiking boots, bulky quilted-cotton car coat in dreary beige, and the orange sari hanging in folds beneath it. I am probably a little odd myself by Cambridge standards, enfolded in my cape of muted purples and greens. Mira 's charm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big iron key, and we are soon letting ourselves into the locked chapel. <p> " What a powerful energy here, " she murmurs, closing her eyes. <p> I begin to feel something too. I always feel a call to meditate when I 'm with Mira. It 's as if there is a presence around her presence, a motherly aura that enfolds her and takes me into its embrace also. I give myself to this feeling, and everything else disappears -- the dark wooden choir stalls, the carved pulpit, the stained glass. <p> After a few minutes, I hear Mira 's voice. " I feel myself in all these figures, " she says, looking at a large painting of the Annunciation on the side wall. The Virgin, in voluminous blue draperies, is gazing in surprise and mystery at the skinny angel, who is almost shyly holding out a lily to her. " They have given me so many faces, so many forms. But I find myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment. It is a beautiful idea, somehow. I smile at her. " And I ca n't even find one self, " I say. <p> But Mira is not paying any attention. She has stepped down from the wooden stall and is kneeling on the marble tile floor, gazing up at the painting. I shiver with fear, then do the only thing that comes naturally to me at the moment. I join her kneeling in front of the Virgin in voluminous folds of blue, who is just getting the news from that frail angel holding out his lily. I lean forward, in a shiver of ecstasy, and touch my head to the floor. <p> A day later, Friday afternoon, in the warm basement kitchen of Wendell 's north London row house, Harriet and Wendell and I have been talking painfully. Harriet has just been crying. With rushed apologies, she and Wendell retreat into her little girl Heather 's room to talk. Heather stays in the kitchen with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright-eyed child with her short, modern haircut walks up to me with a paper sticker in her hand. She presses it onto my sweater, then goes off to her room. " I want my room back! " she calls ahead of herself in warning. <p> I look down at the sticker -- find to my astonishment that it is a picture of a nun in a black habit. Where did she get such a thing? I quickly pull it off and crumple it into a tight little wad. <p> When Harriet and Wendell come back from Heather 's room, all three of us sit down. An embarrassed Wendell makes tea while Harriet and I apologize to one another. <p> " I did n't know, " I say. " I 'm terribly sorry, I did n't know. " <p> " Well -- we did n't know either, " says Harriet. " Or rather -- we pretended not to. " <p> " Still -- Wendell should have told me. There was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- Wendell 's been rather cowardly about it, " says Harriet. " He 's made it very hard for me -- and for you too, I suspect. " <p> Wendell hunches guiltily over the tea kettle, like a found-out Dickensian villain smiling up at us from his bent head, his loose blond hair hanging beside his arch brows his embarrassed smile. <p> " I 'll leave today, " I say. <p> " Oh, no, you must n't do that, " says Harriet. <p> " We 'll have our trip to Brighton first, " says Wendell. " I promised you that. " <p> Afterward, I will always remember that I was desperate or greedy or confused enough to accept. That I allowed Wendell to drive off to Brighton with me, leaving Harriet, who loved him, to work out her feelings alone with her child in London Leaving Harriet, my fellow feminist to sleep and think alone. And what about my own self-respect? Where had that fled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearing up brightly, Wendell and I drive through storybook villages to Brighton, past the disappointing pavilion with its tawdry onion towers, and find a charming little hotel, where our bodies bid each other farewell. It is such an old friendship, such a " funny glue, " Wendell calls it, that draws us together even when we 're saying goodbye. <p> " I 'm sorry it 's all turned out like this, " says Wendell, as we sip coffee the next morning. " You see, I thought you 'd be staying part of the time at Mira 's, I did n't realize you 'd be the whole time with me. " <p> " I wish you 'd told me, " I say. " Because there was n't room at Mira 's, you know. " <p> " I know, " he says. " But if we 'd discussed all that, you 'd never have come, would you " <p> I laugh. " Maybe not, " I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did? " He smiles at me over his coffee cup, his eyebrows raised half-pleadingly, half-mockingly. We are in the hotel 's tiny dining room, sitting at a small table near the lace-covered corner window. <p> I think, I search, I try to find the answer. " I 'm sorry about the mess we made, " I say. " I 'm sorry to have hurt Harriet, and you know I 'm not unscathed myself. " <p> " Nor I, " says Wendell. <p> " Not scathed enough, " I say. " You seem to get off awfully easy somehow! " <p> " That remains to be seen, " says Wendell. <p> " You mean, will Harriet forgive you? " <p> " Oh, I do n't know, not that so much. Just -- how I feel about things, I suppose. I do have a conscience of sorts, you know. " <p> " But it comes into play so late, does n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " I say. " There were clues. I just did n't want to read them. I 'll know better next time. " <p> " I suppose you will, " he smiles, gazing at me affectionately. " I suppose our funny old glue will have to dissolve sometime. " <p> " I ca n't help being glad that I saw you somehow, " I smile back. " And ever so glad I saw Mira. " <p> " No complications there, " says Wendell. <p> " No, none there, " I say, because I can not tell him how changed Mira is, and how bewildered and worried I am. <p> " Come, " he says, setting down his cup. " You must see Brighton Pier before we head back. " <p> It 's a chilly walk to the pier, the sky gray, the January wind blowing from the sea. Wendell leads us to the abandoned amusement pier, a strangely garish wooden structure over the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost everything is closed for the winter. Detached, companionable, we gaze out at the gray sea. Amidst the shuttered booths, a glass case shelters a mechanical automaton " fat lady " who rocks back and forth with hands on knees. She sits draped in chipped and fading painted reds and blues, carnival threads with a Renaissance touch. Her pink-enamel cheeks bulge up against her merry eyes, as she laughs a ghastly, tinny laugh, inviting us to enter a show that has closed for the season. Hahahahaha! she cackles. The show is closed, but do n't take it so seriously. Maybe you have new journeys to make, better discoveries than last season 's sideshow! Hahahahaha! And the wind whips about, and the boards creak beneath our feet, and everything sways a bit, as we walk on Brighton Pier. <p> The next day Mira and Wendell meet for the first time in years, as they ride with me together on the train to Gatwick Airport. It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together. They seem suddenly to like one another, in this festivity of my departure, trading witticisms and laughing at each other 's jokes. I am laughing too, basking in the sweetness of this rare conjunction. <p> At the airport, I try to get them to pose for their pictures in one of the passport photo booths. " I do n't have recent pictures of either of you, " I urge. <p> " No, you give your picture to us, " says Wendell. <p> " Yes, you must do it for us, " says Mira. <p> " Only if you take your pictures after me, " I say, and they hedge and demur, and push me into the shiny plastic booth. I smile at the face in the mirror. Fool that she is, she looks unscathed and smiles back at me brightly. She does n't tell me what we have learned, though I know there is something. There are buzzes and clicks, and soon I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between myself and my friends, with the help of Mira 's nail file. <p> Next time I see Mira Bai, we are back in the United States, swimming in a pond where geese are nesting. Her speech has grown strangely halting, and her presence seems vague. " Do you see that lead goose? " she asks me, after we have pulled ourselves onto a little dock, and sit drying ourselves. " That 's my Grandfather Morrow. He 's come back as that goose to watch over me. Watch now, he 'll lead them right to me. " The goose indeed swims at the head of a flock of eight or nine, swimming in a V formation, right to the dock where we sit dangling our feet in the water. We have no bread to give them. <p> Soon after this we will learn that Mira has a cruel brain disease, one that leaves her memory, but takes away her reason and finally all ability to function. It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leonardo 's Madonna. For a long time I am so devastated, so angry over this, that I blame Guruji, blame all religions and whatever is behind them, East or West -- and I find ways to blame myself, as well. Finally, though, I accept that what betrayed her was not the spiritual lie, but something in her body 's secret workings, something chromosomal, if the latest research is correct. <p> In the meantime, I have met the love who now brings hope and happiness to my life -- a life that still seems to be expanding, while my beloved friend 's diminishes so painfully. I thought of leaving this out of the story. Is n't it too big a stretch, to tell you my " happy ending "? Is n't it an afterthought, irrelevant? My love arrived in time to get to know Mira, while there was still enough of her left to know, before her jaunty voice, her laughter, her sweet meditations, are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died, after years of illness borne with kindness and laughter, and Mira is too incapacitated, too near death herself, to speak ; tears fall down the cheeks of her expressionless face when she is told of his death. When I go to pay my respects, chanting with others beside his body heaped with flowers, I wish that Mira could be with us ; and I begin to hope again that maybe her years of meditation are somehow sustaining her beyond where I can know or see, like that glimpse of distant waters behind the rocks. <p> In a lagoon scattered with high, treacherous rocks, a smiling Virgin hands her child to the angel sitting near her, then climbs one o the highest rocks and stands there gazing down, that smile of rapture and adventure in her eyes. She unclasps the brooch that is a family heirloom, lets her cloak fall to her feet, and springs into a perfect dive, plunging in elegant form to the rough waters below. She swims like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Condor and Hummingbird, " was published by Alice Walker 's Wild Trees Press. Her second, " Touching Earth, " is in search of a publisher. <p>
