1004641 Mrs. Doosilly and Willy Doosilly came out to the supermarket parking lot with their arms full of grocery bags. Willy Doosilly held the bag with the mint chocolate chip ice cream. " Hurry, Willy, or we 'll be late for your oboe lesson, " said Mrs. Doosilly as she hurried to the car. She tried to unlock the door on the driver 's side. Nothing happened. She turned the key again, but the door still would not unlock. " Oh, honestly! " said Mrs. Doosilly. " What in the world is the matter with this car now? " Mrs. Doosilly tried unlocking the door on the other side. She tried the door in the back. None of them would open. She peered through the window of the car and sighed. " Well, something is definitely the matter, " said Mrs. Doosilly. " I do n't know what to do. " " But, Mom- " said Willy. " Please be quiet! " said Mrs. Doosilly. " I have to think of something to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French poodle on a leash. " Excuse me, " said Mrs. Doosilly. " I ca n't unlock my car, my son is late for his oboe lesson, and our ice cream is melting. Can you help? " " I 'll try, " said the woman. First she tried the door on the driver 's side. Then she tried the door on the other side. Then she tried the back door. None of them would open. She and her French poodle peered into the windows. " I ca n't get it open, " she said. " Oh my, " said Mrs. Doosilly. " Neither can I. What can I do? " " But, Mom- " said Willy. " Hush, Willy, while I think of something. " <p> A man walked by humming a little tune. " Excuse me, sir, but I ca n't get into my car, my son is late for his oboe lesson, and our ice cream is melting. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the man. He hummed while he tried the door on the driver 's side. He hummed while he tried the door on the other side. He hummed while he tried the back door. Finally he stopped humming and peered through the car window. " Something 's wrong, " said the man. " Very wrong, " said the woman with the French poodle. " Oh my, " said Mrs. Doosilly. " What can I do now? " " But, Mom- " said Willy. " Quiet, Willy, " said Mrs. Doosilly. " Something must be done! " Mrs. Doosilly stopped a Girl Scout troop as they were walking by, a soccer team on their way to a game, a clown on his way to the circus, a marching band on its way to a parade, and a kindergarten class on their way to the zoo. No one could help. They all waited to see what Mrs. Doosilly would do. " I guess I 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. She took a can of peas out of the bag. Then she wound up her arm as if she were a baseball pitcher. " NO, MOM, WAIT! " shouted Willy. Everyone turned to look at him. " Oh, Willy, what is it? " " That 's our car over there! " said Willy. And so it was. Mrs. Doosilly thanked everyone for their-help. Then she and Willy drove home. It was too late for Willy 's oboe lesson, so they drank mint chocolate chip soup instead. <p>
