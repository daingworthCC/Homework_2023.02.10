" Is something worrying you? A ghost just went over your grave. " This observation was too close for comfort. " I was thinking about Edie 's cousin. I do n't like her. " " Oh, Henry. " " I do n't think Edie is safe with her. " Vi made a little face. " To be honest, Henry, I 'm not very happy either. But I think that it 's just a great trial for Edie. We talk about her cousin in the mornings, over coffee. Lottie 's certainly a very tiresome lady, but apart from driving Edie to distraction with her ways, I do n't think Edie 's in any real danger. Not the kind you 're imagining. " He had n't told her what he imagined, but she knew. Vi always knew things like that. " You will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? You wo n't let anything happen? " " No, of course I wo n't. And I shall make a point of seeing Edie every day, and keeping an eye on the situation. And I 'll ask Lottie for tea one day, and that 'll give Edie a bit of a breather. " " When do you think Lottie will go away? " " I do n't know. When she 's better. These things take time? ' " Edie was so happy, on her own. And now she 's not happy a bit. And she has to sleep on the Put-U-Up. It must be horrid not being in her own room. " " Edie is a very kind person. More kind than most of us. She is making a sacrifice for her cousin. " Henry thought of Abraham and Isaac. " I hope Lottie does n't make a sacrifice of her. " Vi laughed. " You 're letting your imagination run away with you. Do n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother again tomorrow. " " Yes. " That was much better. " What time do you think she 'll come? " " Well, you 've got a busy day tomorrow, out with Willy Snoddy and his ferrets. I should think about tea-time. When you get back, she 'll be here. " " Do you think she 'll bring me a present from London? " " Sure to. " s " Perhaps she 'll bring you a present, too. " " Oh, I do n't expect a present. Besides, it 's my birthday soon, so I 'll get one then. She always gives me something quite special, something that I never realized how much I wanted. " p151 " What day is your birthday? " He had forgotten. " The fifteenth of September. The day before the Steyntons ' party. " " Are you going to have the picnic? " Vi always arranged a picnic for her birthday. Everybody came, and they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooked sausages, and Vi brought her birthday cake in a big box, and when she cut it, the assembled party stood around and sang " Happy Birthday to You. " Sometimes it was a chocolate cake, and sometimes it was an orange cake. Last year it had been an orange cake. He remembered last year. Remembered the inclement day, the racing wind and the scattered showers that had dampened nobody 's enthusiasm. Last year he had given Vi a picture that he had drawn with his felt pens, and which his mother had had framed and mounted, just like a proper picture. Vi had it hanging in her bedroom. This year he was giving her the bottle of rhubarb wine that he had won in the raffle at the church sale. This year... He said, " This year, I sha n't be there. " " No. This year, you 'll be at boarding-school. " " Could n't you have your birthday earlier, so that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthdays do n't work that way. But it wo n't be the same without you. " " Will you write me a letter, and tell me all about it? " " Of course I will. And you shall write to me. There 'll be such a lot that I will want to hear. " He said, " I do n't want to go. " " No. I do n't suppose you do. But your father thinks that you should go, and he nearly always knows best. " " Mummy does n't want me to go, either. " " That 's because she loves you so. She knows that she 'll miss you. " He realized then that this was the first time he and Vi had talked about f his going away. This was because Henry did not even want to think about it, let alone discuss it, and Vi had never brought the subject up. But now they had started speaking about it, he discovered that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Vi, and knew, too, that she would never repeat it. He said, " They 've been quarrelling. They 've been cross with each other. " " Yes, " said Vi. " I know. " " How do you know, Vi? " " I may be old, but I 'm not stupid. And your father is my son. Mothers ' know lots about their sons. The good bits and the not-so-good bits. It p152 does n't stop them loving them, but it makes them a little bit more under-standing. " " It 's been so horrid, with them so unkind to each other. " " It must have been. " " I do n't want to go away to school, but I hate them being cross with each other. I simply hate it. It makes the house feel all headachy and ill. " Vi sighed. " If you want to know what I think, Henry, I think they 've both been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to say anything, because it 's none of my business. That 's another thing a mother must n't do. She must never interfere. " " I really want to go home tomorrow, but... " He gazed at her, his sentence left unfinished, because he did n't really know what he was trying to say. Vi smiled. When she smiled her face creased into a thousand wrinkles. She laid her hand on his. It felt warm and dry, and rough from all the gardening she did. She said, " There 's an old saying, that parting makes the heart grow fonder. Your mother and father have had a few days apart, on their own, with time to think things over. I 'm sure they 'll both have realized how wrong they both have been. You see, they love each other very much, and if you love someone, you need to be with them, close to them. You need to be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as important as breathing. By now, I 'm certain that they will have found this out. And I 'm just as certain that everything will be just as it was before. " " Really certain, Vi? " " Really certain. " She sounded so certain that Henry felt that way too. Such a relief. It was as though a huge weight had dropped from his shoulders. And this made everything much better. Even the prospect of leaving home and parents and being sent to board at Templehall had lost some of its fearfulness. Nothing could be as bad as thinking that his home would never be the same again. Reassured, and filled with grateful love for his grandmother, he held out his arms, and she leaned forward, and he embraced her, hugging her tight around her neck and pressing kisses on her cheek. When he drew back, he saw that her eyes were very shiny and bright. She said, " It 's time to sleep. " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay back on the pillow and felt beneath it for Moo. Vi laughed at him, but gently, teasing him. " You do n't need that old bit of baby blanket. You 're a grown-up boy now. You can make fairy p153 cakes, and do jigsaw puzzles, and remember the names of all those wild flowers. I think you can do without Moo. " Henry screwed up his nose. " But not tonight, Vi. " " All right. Not tonight. But tomorrow, maybe. " " Yes. " He yawned. " Maybe. " She stooped to kiss him, and then got up off the bed. The springs creaked once more. " Good night, my lamb. " " Good night, Vi. " She turned out his light and went out of the room, but she left the door open. The darkness was soft and blowy and smelt of the hills. Henry turned on his side, curled up in a ball, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TEN YEARS AGO, VIOLET AIRD bought Pennyburn from Archie Balmerino, she had become owner of a sad and drab little house with little to commend it save its view and the small stream that tumbled down the hill on the western march of its land. It was from this stream that the house took its name. It stood in the heart of Archie 's estate, on the face of the hill that sloped up from the village, and access was by the Croy back drive and then a rutted track overgrown by thistles and fenced by sagging posts and broken barbed wire. The garden, such as it was, lay on the slope to the south of the house. This too was surrounded by rotting posts and straggling wire, and consisted of a small drying-green, a weedy vegetable patch, and dismal evidences of hen-keeping -- leaning wooden sheds, much wire netting, and nettles grown waist-high. The house was built of dull coloured stone, with a grey-tiled roof and maroon paintwork in a sad state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the door, and inside were small and lightless rooms, hideous peeling wallpaper, the smell of damp, and the persistent drip of ' some faulty tap. In fact, so unattractive was the entire property that Edmund Aird, viewing it for the first time, strongly recommended that his mother abandon the idea of ever living there and start to look for somewhere else. But Violet, for reasons of her own, liked the house. It had stood empty for some years, which accounted for its dereliction, but despite the mould and the gloom, it had a pleasant feel to it. And it had that little burn within its lands, tumbling away down the hill. And, as well, the view. Inspecting the house, Violet would pause from time to time to glance out, p155 rubbing a clear space on the dusty glass of the windows, seeing the village below, the river, the glen, the distant hills. She would never find another house with such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she disregarded her son 's advice. Doing it all up had been tremendous fun. It had taken six months to complete the work, and during that time Violet -- politely spurning Ed-mund 's invitation to remain at Balnaid until such time as she could move into her new abode -- camped in a caravan that she had rented from a tourist park a few miles up the glen. She had never lived in a caravan before, but the idea had always appealed to her gypsy instincts and she leaped at the chance. The caravan was parked at the back of the house, along with the concrete mixers and barrows and shovels and daunting piles of rubble, and from the open door she could keep an eye on the workmen, and dash out to have a word with the long-suffering architect the moment she spied his car come bumping up the road. For the first month or two of this cheerfully vagabond existence, it was summer, and the only hazards were the midges and a leaky roof whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the caravan trembled beneath their blast and rocked unsteadily at its temporary mooring, not unlike a small boat in a storm. Violet found this quite exciting and relished the dark and gusty nights. She could lie in her bunk, which was far too short and too narrow for such a sizy lady, listening to the keening wind and watching the clouds racing across the cold, moonlit skies. But she did not spend all her time alternately bullying and cajoling the builders. To Violet, a garden was even more important than a house. Before the workmen had started in on their labours, she had already engaged a man with a tractor, who tore up all the old fence posts and broken wire. In their place she planted a beech hedge on either side of her driveway and all around her small plot of land. After ten years, this was not high, but thick and firm, always leafy, and so providing good shelter for birds. Within this hedge, on either side, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not her favourites, but quick-growing and good for keeping the Horst of the coldest wind at bay. On the west, overhanging the stream,? r ew gnarled elder, willows, and double white cherries. At the foot of the garden she had kept her planting low, in order to conserve the view. Azaleas grew there, and potentillas, with drifts of spring bulbs in the hough grass. There were two curving flower-beds, one herbaceous and one filled th roses, and between them a good-sized lawn. This was on the slope tricky to cut. Violet had bought an electric lawn-mower, but Ed-156 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p156 mund -- interfering again -- decided that she was likely to sever the flex and electrocute herself, and so engaged the services of Willy Snoddy to come once a week and do the job for her. Violet knew perfectly well that Willy was a great deal less competent than she herself at handling complicated equipment, but she went along with the arrangement as being the line of least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low with a killing hangover, did not turn up, and then Violet, quite happily and efficiently, cut the grass herself. But she did not tell Edmund that she had done so. As for the house, that she had transformed, turning it back to front and opening out all the poky and ill-proportioned rooms. Now the main entrance stood to the north and the old front door had become a glassed garden door, opening straight out of her sitting-room. The concrete stairs she had demolished, and in their place stood a semi-circular flight of steps built of old stone salvaged from a fallen dyke. Aubrietia and scented thyme grew from crannies between these rocks and smelt delicious when one trod upon them. After some consideration, Violet decided that she could not bear the dull colour of the stone walls of Pennyburn, and so had them all harled and painted white. Windows and doorways were outlined in black, which gave the face of the house a crisp and down-to-earth appearance. To embellish it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten years, it had scarcely grown as high as her shoulder. By the time it reached the roof, she would probably be dead. At seventy-seven one was perhaps better off sticking to hardy annuals. All that was missing was a conservatory. The one at Balnaid had been built at the same time as the house. Its erection was due to the insistence of Violet 's mother, Lady Primrose Akenside, a woman not addicted to the great outdoors. It was Lady Primrose 's opinion that, if forced to live in the wilds of Scotland, a conservatory was absolutely essential. Quite apart from the fact that it was useful for keeping the house supplied with pot plants and grapes, it was somewhere to sit when the sun shone and yet the wind blew with an edge like ice to it. Such days, everybody knew, occurred with amazing frequency during the winter and spring and autumn months. But Lady Primrose spent a good deal of the summers in her conservatory as well, entertaining her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservatory for less social reasons, relishing the warmth, the peace, the smell of damp earth and ferns and freesias. When the weather was too inclement to garden, you could always potter about in the conservatory, and what better place to sit down after lunch and try to do The Times crossword? p157 Yes, she missed it, but after deliberation had decided that Pennyburn was too small and modest for such an extravagant addition. It would make the house look pretentious and foolish, and she was not about to inflict such an indignity upon her new home. And it was scarcely a hardship to sit in her sheltered and sunny garden and try to do the crossword there. She was in her garden now, and had been out working all afternoon, staking clumps of Michaelmas daisies before the autumn winds arrived to ell them flat. It was a day to start thinking about autumn. Not cold but sh, with a certain smell about the air, a briskness. The. farmers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tall elds of barley was seasonal and strangely reassuring. The sky was blue t sailing with clouds blown in from the west. A blinking day, the old untry people called it, as the sun went in and out. Unlike many people, Violet did not mourn the passing of the summer nd the prospect of a long dark winter ahead. " How can you bear to live Scotland? ' she was sometimes asked. " The weather so unpredictable, much rain, so cold. " But Violet knew that she could not bear to live ywhere else, and never yearned to move away. When Geordie was alive ey had travelled together extensively. They had explored Venice and tanbul, paced the art galleries of Florence and Madrid.

The canes showed, once the Michaelmas daisies had thickened out a bit, they would be ealed. She looked at her watch. Nearly half past three. She sighed, ys reluctant to stop gardening and go indoors. But she stripped off 158 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p158 her gloves and dropped them into her wheelbarrow, then collected her tools, the last of the canes, the drum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her garage, where all was stowed neatly away until the next day 's labour. Then she went into the house by the kitchen door, toeing off her rubber boots and hanging her jacket on a hook. In the kitchen, she filled the kettle and switched it on to boil. She laid a tray with two cups and saucers, a milk jug, a sugar bowl, and a plate of chocolate digestive biscuits.( Virginia would not eat anything at teatime but Violet was never averse to a small snack.) She went upstairs to her bedroom, washed her hands, found a pair of ' shoes, tidied her hair, slapped a bit of face powder onto her shining nose. As she did this, she heard the car come up the hill and turn into the lane. A moment later came the slam of its door, her own front door opening, and Virginia 's voice. " Vii " " Just coming. " She settled her pearls, fixed a stray wisp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hall waiting for her ; her long legs were in corduroys and a leather jacket was slung around her shoulders. She had a new hair-do, Violet noticed, drawn back from her brow and fastened at the nape of her neck with a ribbon bow. She looked, as always, casually elegant, and happier than Violet had seen her for a long time. " Virginia. How lovely to have you home again. And how chic you look. I love the hair. " They kissed. " Did you have it done in London? " " Yes. I thought perhaps it was time I changed my image. " She looked about her. " Where 's Henry? " " He 's out ferreting with Willy Shoddy. " " Oh, Vi. " " It 's all right. He 'll be home in half an hour. " " I did n't mean that. I meant what 's he doing spending his time with that old reprobate? " " Well, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in school. And he got talking to Willy when he came to cut the grass this week, and Willy invited him to go ferreting. He seemed very keen to go, so I said he could. You do n't disapprove, do you? " Virginia laughed and shook her head. " No, of course not. It 's just rather unexpected. Do you think Henry realizes what ferreting entails? It 's quite a bloodthirsty business. " " I 've no idea. We 'll doubtless hear all about it when he gets back. Willy will see that he 's on time, I know. " p159 " I always thought you thought the old drunk was quite undepend-able. " " He would n't dare break his promise to me, and he never gets drunk in the afternoons. Now, how are you? Did you have a good time? " " A great time. Here... " She thrust a flat package, impressively wrapped, into Violet 's hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City. " " My dear, you did n't need to. " " It 's a thank-you for having Henry, " " I 've loved having him. But he 's longing to see you and go home to Balnaid. He was all packed up and ready long before breakfast this morning. Now, I want to hear all about everything. Come and watch me open my present. " She led the way into her sitting-room and settled herself in comfort in her own fireside chair. It was a relief to get the weight off her feet. Virginia perched herself on the arm of the sofa and watched. Violet undid e ribbon bow and unwrapped the paper. A flat box, orange and brown, as revealed. She removed the lid. Inside, folded and silken beneath the yers of tissue paper, was a Hermes scarf. " Oh, Virginia. This is far too much. " " No more than you deserve. " " But having Henry was a treat. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's in the car. I thought he could en it here, before I take him home. " The scarf was all pinks and blues and greens. Just the thing for brighting up that grey woollen dress. " I ca n't thank you enough -- I 'm really lighted with it. And now... " She folded the scarf, returned it to its x, and set it aside. " Let 's have a cup of tea, and you can tell me rything that 's happened in London. I want to hear all the de- " When did you get back? " " Yesterday evening, on the shuttle. Edmund met me at Turnhouse and went into Edinburgh and had dinner at Rafaelli 's, and after that we leave home to Balnaid. " " 1 hope "? Violet fixed Virginia with a firm stare? " that you used the e together to sort out your differences, " 160 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p160 Virginia had the grace to look abashed. " Oh, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was obvious to anyone but a blind man. I did n't say anything, but you must realize that it 's very worrying for Henry if you and his father are not on good terms. " " Did Henry talk to you about it? " " Yes, he did. He 's much upset. I think he feels that going to Ternplehall is bad enough, but having you and Edmund at each other 's throats is more than he can bear. " " We were n't exactly at each other 's throats. " " Icy politeness is almost worse. " " I know. And I 'm sorry. And Edmund and I have made it up. By that I do n't mean anything 's changed. Edmund wo n't budge from his decision, and I still think it 's a dreadful mistake. But at least we 've called a truce. " She smiled and held out a slender wrist circled by a wide bracelet of gold. " Over dinner, he gave me this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be churlish to carry on sulking. " " That is a great relief to me. I managed to persuade Henry that you would both have come to your senses and would be friends again. And I 'm grateful to you both, because now I do n't feel that I am letting him down. He needs a lot of reassurance, Virginia. A lot of security. " " Oh, Vi, do n't I know it? " " And there 's another thing. He 's very bothered about Edie. He 's frightened of Lottie. He thinks that Lottie might harm Edie in some way. " Virginia frowned. " Did he say so? " " We talked about it. " " Do you think he 's right? " " Children are perceptive. Like dogs. They recognize evil where, perhaps, we adults do n't see it. " " Evil is a strong word, Vi. I know she gives me the shivers, but I 've always told myself she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know, " said Violet. " But I 've promised Henry that we will all keep a weather eye on the situation. And if he talks to you about it, you must listen to him, and try to set his mind at rest. " " Of course. " " Now. " With that necessary exchange safely disposed of, Violet steered the conversation into a more cheerful direction. " Tell me about London. Did you get a dress? And what else did you do? And did you see Alexa? " " Yes. " Virginia leaned forward to refill her cup from the teapot. " Yes, p161 I did get a dress, and yes, I did see Alexa. That 's what I want to talk to you about. I 've already told Edmund. " Violet 's heart sank. What on earth was happening now? " She 's all right? " " Never better. " Virginia leaned back in her chair. " There is a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man? But that 's splendid news! I was beginning to ink that nothing exciting was ever going to happen to the dear child. " " They 're living together, Vi. " For an instant, Violet was silenced. Then : " Living together? " " Yes. And I 'm not telling tales out of school. She particularly asked me let you know. " " And where are they living together? " " At Ovington Street. " " But... " Violet, flustered, sought for words. " But... how long s this been going on? " " About two months. " " Who is he? " " He 's called Noel Keeling. " " What does he do? " " He 's in advertising. " " How old is he? " " About my age. Good-looking. Very charming. " About Virginia 's age. A dreadful thought occurred to Violet. " I hope s not already married. " " No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @? " " Alexa is radiantly happy. " " Do you think they will marry? " " I have no idea. " " Is he kind to her? " " I think so. I only saw him for a little while. He came home from the ce and we all had a drink together. He brought Alexa flowers. And he n't know I was going to be there, so he did n't buy them to impress Violet fell silent, trying to come to terms with this astonishing revela-. They were living together. Alexa was living with a man. Sharing a, sharing a life. Unmarried. She did not approve but her own opinions e best kept to herself. All that mattered was that Alexa should know t they all would support her, whatever might happen. " What did Edmund say when you told him? " p162 Virginia shrugged. " Not a lot. He 's certainly not about to fly to London with a loaded shotgun. But I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexa is a girl of some wealth... she has that house and she has the money she inherited from Lady Cheriton. Which, as Edmund pointed out, is considerable. " " He 's afraid this young man is after her money? " " It 's a possibility, Vi. " " You 've met him. What do you think of him? " " I liked him.... " " But you have reservations? " " He 's so personable. Cool. Like I said, charming. I 'm not certain if I trust him.... " " Oh dear. " " But that 's just me talking. I may be making a total misjudgement. " " What can we do? " " We ca n't do anything. Alexa is twenty-one, she must make her own decisions. " Violet knew that. this was true. But Alexa. so far away. In Lon-don. " If only we could meet him. That would put everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely agree with you, and you will meet him. " Violet glanced at her daughter-in-law and saw that she was smiling, looking as pleased with herself as the cat that got the cream. " I 'm afraid I stuck my oar in and made noises like a mother. I talked to the two of them and they 've agreed to come north together for the weekend of the Steyntons ' dance. They 're going to stay at Balnaid. " " Oh, what a clever idea! " Violet could have kissed Virginia, so delighted was she. " What a brilliant girl you are. Quite the best way of doing things, without making too much of an occasion of it. " " That 's what I thought. And even Edmund approves. But we 'll have to be very casual and tactful and matter-of-fact. No suggestive glances or meaningful remarks. " " You mean I 'm not to say anything about their getting married? " Virginia nodded. Violet thought about this. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern to know when to hold my tongue. But, by living together, young people create for themselves such difficult situations. They make it so difficult for us. If v.? e make too much of the young man, then he will think he is being pressurized and he 'll back off and break Alexa 's heart. And if we do n't make enough of him, Alexa will think we, disapprove and that will break her heart. " p163 " I would n't be too sure about that. She 's grown up a lot. She has much more confidence. She 's changed. " " I could n't bear her to be hurt. Not Alexa. " " I 'm afraid we ca n't protect her any longer. The affair has already gone too far. " " Yes, " said Violet, feeling in some way admonished. This was no time for apprehensive sentiment. If she was to be of any use to anybody, then she must remain sensible. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there was no time for more. They heard the front door open and slam shut. " Mummy! " Henry was back. Virginia laid down her teacup and sprang to her feet, Alexa forgotten. She made for the door but Henry was there first, bursting in on them, red-cheeked with excitement and the effort of running up the hill. " Mummy! " She held out her arms, and he flung himself, bodily, into them. p104 Saturday the Twenty-seventh EDMUND WAS FREQUENTLY ASKED, by well-meaning fellow-guests at dinner parties, if he did not find the long commute between Edinburgh and Strathcroy an almost unbearable strain, every morning and evening each day of the week that he was working in Edinburgh. But the truth was that Edmund thought nothing of the miles that he covered. Getting home to Balnaid and his family was more important than the considerable effort that it involved, and only a late business dinner in Edinburgh, an early plane to catch, or impassable winter roads persuaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flat in Moray Place. As well, he enjoyed driving. His car was both powerful and safe, and the motorway, slicing over the Forth and through Fife to Relkirk, had become as familiar as the back of his hand. Once through Relkirk, he was onto country roads that necessitated slowing down to a more prudent speed, but even so the journey rarely took him more than an hour. He used this time to switch off at the end of a day of stress and decision-making, and to let his mind concentrate instead upon the many other, but equally absorbing, facets of his busy life. In winter-time, he listened to the radio. Not the news nor political discussions... he had had enough of both by the time he finally cleared his desk and locked away all confidential documents... but Radio Three, classical concerts and erudite plays.

The scenery was both peaceful and spectacular. Fields and farmlands were washed in fitful sunlight, but the air was so clear that every crag and corrie on the distant hills presented itself with startling visibility. The light flowed over these hills, touching their summits with reflected radiance ; the river runping alongside the road glittered and sparkled ; and the sky, skimming with clouds, was infinite.

As well, there were other good things to look forward to. This evening, would see his small son again after a week of separation. There would much to tell and much to hear. And then, next month, in September, exa was bringing her young man to stay. Virginia 's bombshell about Alexa had caught Edmund unawares, renring him confounded but not shocked nor disapproving. He was exmely fond of his daughter, and recognized her many sterling qualities ; t during the last year or two he had privately wished, more than once, at she would take her finger out and start to grow up. At twenty-one, r lack of sophistication, her shyness, her dumpy shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to being surrounded by elegant and 166 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p166 worldly women( even his secretary was a stunner) and disliked himself for his own impatience and irritation with Alexa. But now, all by herself, she had found a man, and a personable one, if Virginia was to be be-lieved. Possibly he should be taking a tougher line. But he had never relished the image of himself as a paterfamilias, and was more concerned with the human side of the situation rather than the moral. As always, when faced with a dilemma, he planned to go by his own set of rules. Act positively, plan negatively, expect nothing. The worst that could happen would be Alexa 's getting hurt. For her, it would be a frightening new experience, but at least she would come out of it more adult and, hopefully, stronger. He drove into Strathcroy as the church clock was striking seven. He thought, in pleasant anticipation, of getting home. The dogs would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Henry, in his bath or eating his tea in the kitchen. He would sit with Henry while he consumed his fish fingers or beefburgers or whatever horror he had chosen to eat, listening to all that Henry had been up to during the week, and drinking, meanwhile, a very long and strong gin and tonic. Which reminded him that they were out of tonic. The drink cupboard had been allowed to run dry of this precious commodity, and Edmund had meant to stop off and buy a crate before he left Edinburgh, but had forgotten to do this. And so he passed the bridge that led to Balnaid and drove on into the village, drawing up outside the Pakistani supermarket. All the other shops had long since shut their doors and closed their shutters, but the Pakistanis never seemed to close. Long after nine o'clock in the evening they were still selling cartons of milk and bread and pizzas and frozen curries to anybody who wanted to buy them. He got out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other customers but they were filling their own wire baskets from the shelves or being assisted by Mr. Ishak, and it was Mrs. Ishak who dimpled at Edmund from behind the counter. She was a comely lady, with huge dark eyes ringed in kohl, and this evening dressed in butter-yellow silk. with a paler yellow silk scarf draped around her head and shoulders. " Good evening, Mr. Aird. " " Good evening, Mrs. Ishak. How are you? " p167 " I am very well, thank you for asking. " " How 's Kedejah? " " She is watching television. " " I hear she had an afternoon at Pennyburn with Henry. " " That is true, and my God, she came home soaking wet. " Edmund laughed. " They were building dams. I hope you were n't an-noyed. " " Not at all. She has had a most lovely time. " " I want some tonic water, Mrs. Ishak. Have you got some? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need? " " Two dozen? " " If you wait, I will fetch them for you from the store. " " Thank you. " She went. Edmund, unimpatient, stood waiting for her to return. A voice spoke from behind him. " Mr. Aird. " It was so close, just behind his shoulder, that he was much startled. He swung around and found himself faced by Edie 's cousin, Lottie Carstairs. Since she had come to stay with Edie, he had glimpsed her once or twice, pottering about the village, but had taken some pains and avoiding action, not wishing to be confronted by her. Now it seemed she had him cornered and there was no escape. " Good evening. " " Remember me? " She spoke almost coyly. Edmund did not relish finding himself so close to her with her pallid, bloodless skin and the strong suggestion of a moustache upon her upper lip. Her hair was the colour? and roughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arched eyebrows her eyes were brown as currants, and round and quite unwinking. Apart from all this, her appearance was reasonably normal. She wore a blouse and skirt, a long green cardigan perkily embellished with a sparling brooch, and shoes with high heels upon which she tottered slightly she engaged Edmund in conversation. " I used to be with Lady ilmerino, staying with Edie Findhorn right now I am. Seen you around the village, never had the chance of an old chin-wag... " Lottie Carstairs. She must be nearly sixty now, and yet she had not anged so much since those days when she had worked at Croy and used every person in the house untold annoyance and aggravation, ith her stealthy tread and her habit of always appearing just when least anted or expected. Archie always swore that she listened at keyholes, and he had been perpetually throwing doors open in the expectation of itching Lottie there, crouched and eavesdropping. In the afternoons, 168 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p168 Edmund remembered, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muslin apron tied over it. The muslin apron was not Lady Balmerino 's idea but Lottie 's. Archie said it was because she wanted to appear servile. The brown dress had stains under the armpits, and one of the worst things about Lottie was her smell. The family complained vociferously and Archie demanded that his mother take some step to rectify the situation. Either sack the bloody woman or do something to ensure a little personal daintiness. But poor Lady Balmerino, with Archie 's wedding on her mind, every bed filled with guests and a party planned at Croy on the evening of the great day, did not feel strong enough to sack her housemaid. And she was far too kind-hearted actually to send for Lottie, face her fair and square, and tell her that she smelt. Under attack, she fell back on feeble excuses. " I must have someone to clean the rooms and make the beds. " " We 'll make our own beds. " " Poor thing, she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy her another. " " Perhaps she 's nervous. " " Not too nervous to wash. Give her a bar of Lifebuoy. " " I 'm not certain that that would make much difference. Perhaps.. for Christmas... I could give her some talcum powder...? " But even this timid notion came to nothing, for, soon after the wedding, Lottie dropped the tray and broke the Rockingham china, and Lady Balmerino was finally driven to firing her. By Christmas Lottie was gone from Croy. Now, trapped in Mr. Ishak 's shop, Edmund wondered if she still smelt. He was not about to risk finding out. Trying not to make it too obvious, he moved a pace or two away from her. " Yes, " he said, sounding as pleasant and friendly as he could. " Of course, I remember you... " " Those days at Croy! The year Archie was wed to Isobel. Oh my, what times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the wedding and around the place all that week, helping Lady Balmerino with one thing and another. " " It seems a long time ago. " " Yes. " " And all of you so young. And old Lord and Lady Balmerino so good and kind. Croy 's changed now, I hear, and not for the better. But then, hard times come to everybody. It was a sad day when Lady Balmerino died. She was always so good to me. She was good to my parents too. My mother and my father died, You knew that, did n't you? I 've been wanting p169 to talk to you, but somehow I missed you in the village. And all of you so young. And Archie with his two good legs... fancy getting his leg shot offl Never heard of anything so ridiculous... " Oh, Mrs. Ishak, come back quickly. Please, Mrs. Ishak, come back to e. hear all your news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, she 's grown so fat, ca n't be good for her heart. And all of you so oung. And that Pandora! Flying around the place like a spinning top. readful way she went, was n't it? Funny she never came home. Always hought she might come back for Christmas, but no. And not to be there or Lady Balmerino 's funeral, well, I 'm sorry and I do n't like to say such ings, but in my view, it was downright un-Christian. But then, she! ways was a wee fly-by-night. in more ways than one... you nd I know that, do n't we? " At this point she burst into a peal of manic laughter and actually truck Edmund a playful, but quite painful, blow on his arm. His immeate and instinctive reaction was to hit her right back, a good punch, ng, square on the end of her long, inquisitive nose. He imagined it umpling, concertinaed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the al newspapers : " Relkirkshire Landowner Assaults Strathcroy Lady In illage Supermarket.

" mund could feel the blood rising to his cheeks. He wondered how long could continue to control himself. He could not remember when any on had cast him into such a confusion of impotent rage. "... small his age, I 'd say... not strong... " " I am sorry, Mr. Aird, to keep you so long " It was Mrs. Ishak 's soft ice that finally stilled the flood of Lottie 's mindless malice.

" Of course, Mr. Aird. " " Thank you. " The crate was transferred. With its weight safely in his s, he turned to take his leave of Lottie and make his escape. But Lottie had jumped the gun and was gone. Abruptly and disconingly, she had simply disappeared. p170 Tuesday the Thirtieth " HAS SHE ALWAYS LIVED IN MAJORCA, this aunt of yours? " " No. She 's only been here for about two years. She lived in Pa ' before that, and New York before that, and then California before that, Lucilla said. " A rolling stone. " " Yes, I suppose you could call her that, except that she 's gathered to ' of lovely moss. " Jeff laughed. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know because I 've never seen her. By the time I was born, s was gone, married to an immensely wealthy American and living in Pal Springs. It seemed to me that she must be the most glamorous woman the world. So wicked and sophisticated like someone out of those of 1930 plays, with men falling for her like ninepins, and always u ashamedly outrageous. She eloped when she was eighteen. Such a frigh fully brave thing to do. I 'd never have had the nerve. And she was beauti ful. " " Will she still be beautiful? " " I do n't see why not. After all, she 's only about forty, not over the W i yet. There 's a portrait of her at Croy in the dining-room. It was paint when she was about fourteen and even then she was a stunner.

And when people talked about her, even if they started by being disapproving because she 'd been so thoughtless and uncaring to her parents, they ways ended up by remembering some funny anecdote about Pandora, and then of course there could be nothing but laughter. " p171 " Was she surprised when you spoke to her on the telephone? " " Of course she was. But pleased surprised, not horrified surprised. You can always tell. At first she could hardly believe it was me. But then she just said Of course you can come. As soon as possible. And stay for as long as you like. ' And she gave me directions and hung up. " Lucilla smiled. " So you see, we 're good for at least a week. " They had hired a car, a little Seat, the cheapest they could get, and were now well on their way across the island, driving over flat, intensely cultivated countryside, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon and the road ahead of them shimmered in the heat. On their left, far-distant and hazy, marched a range of impassablelooking mountains. On the other side, somewhere out of sight, lay the sea. For air, they had opened all the windows of the car, but the wind was scorching and dusty and very dry. Jeff was driving and Lucilla sat beside him, holding the scrap of paper on which she had scribbled the directions that Pandora had given her over the telephone. She had rung Pandora from Palma, having arrived with Jeff that morning in a boat from Ibiza. They had spent a week in Ibiza, staying with Jai 's friend, Hans Bergdorf. Hans was a painter and his house had taken some finding, being at the very top of the old town, within the ancient walls of the fortified city. Finally discovered, it had proved very picturesque. It was thick-walled and whitewashed, but primitive beyond belief. The views from its jutting stone balcony took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new town, the harbour, and the sea, but even this delight scarcely made up for the fact that any cooking had to be done on? miniature Calor gas stove and the only running water came from a single cold tap. Consequently, both Jeff and Lucilla were extremely dirty, if not to say smelly, and the bulging backpacks piled onto the back seat of e car were stuffed with unsavoury, soiled and sweaty clothes. Lucilla, ver a girl to spend time worrying about her appearance, had started to ve fantasies about washing her hair, and Jeff in desperation had alwed his beard to grow. It was blonde like his hair, but uneven and straggly and made him look more like a down-and-out than a Viking. In t, the pair of them presented such a disreputable picture that it was a nder that the hire-car man had agreed to rent them the Seat. Lucilla id noticed a certain suspicion on his face, but Jeff had produced a wad of pesetas and, with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She said, " I hope Pandora 's got a washing-machine. " " I 'd settle for a pool. " " You ca n't wash your clothes in a pool. " 172 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p172 " Want a bet? " Lucilla gazed through the open car window. She saw that the mountains had drawn closer and the countryside become more lush. There were pine trees, and the smell of warm resin blew in through the open windows along with the dust. They came to a junction joining another main road. They paused for traffic to pass. The road sign was marked " Puerto del Fuego. " " Well, we 're on the right track. What happens now? " " We take the Puerto del Fuego road, but we have to turn off to the left in another mile or so. It 's a little road and it 's signposted to Cala San Torre. ' " The traffic thinned. Taking his chance Jeff cautiously negotiated the junction. " If we find ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " " That follows. " Now she could smell the sea. Houses appeared, a new apartment block, a garage. They passed a riding stables with scrubby paddocks where sad, bony horses tried to graze. " Oh, poor creatures, " said the tender-hearted Lucilla, but Jeff had eyes only for the road ahead. " There 's a sign. Cala San Torre. ' " " That 's it! " They turned off the sun-baked dual carriageway and found themselves, abruptly, in a green and verdant countryside totally unlike the flat and exposed land through which they had been travelling. Umbrella pines threw shade across the road, speckled by sun splashes, and from ramshackle farms came the contented cackle of hens and the bleat of goats. " It 's suddenly gone pretty, " Lucilla observed. " Oh, look at that sweet little donkey. " " Keep your eyes on the map, girl. What happens next? " Lucilla obediently consulted her notes. " Well, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then we go right up a hill to the last house at the very top. They came upon the turning around the next corner. Jeff changed down and made the turn. The Seat, sounding as though at any moment it might boil like a kettle, ground painfully up the steep and winding lane. There were other houses, large villas scarcely glimpsed beyond closed gates and burgeoning gardens. " This, " said Lucilla, " is what estate agents call a much-sought-after neighbourhood. " " You mean snob. " " I think I mean expensive. " p173 " I think you do too. Your aunt must be loaded. " " She 's got a Californian divorce, " Lucilla told him and her voice implied that there was no need to say more. Another hundred yards or so, another hairpin bend or two, and they bad reached their destination. Casa Rosa. The name, embellished on decorated tiles, was set into a high stone wall and clearly visible despite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A riveway, deeply bordered, sloped up to a garage. The garage had a car rked in it, and another car -- an enviable silver BMW -- was parked in e shade of a gnarled olive tree. Jeff switched off the engine. It was very uiet. Then Lucilla heard water splashing, as though from a fountain, d the distant, gentle clangour of sheep bells. The mountains now were lose by, their summits bleached and barren, their lower slopes silvery ith groves of olive. They got slowly and gratefully out of the car, stretching their sweaty mbs. Up here, so high, there was a breeze blowing off the sea, cool and freshing. Lucilla, looking about her, saw that the Casa Rosa stood on a cky bluff above them, the main entrance reached by a flight of steps, he risers of these steps were set with blue-and-white tiles, and pots of raniums stood sentry all the way to the top. As well, all was entwined a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plumbago, d a tangle of azure-blue morning glory. The air was sweet with flowery nts mingled with the damp smell of newly watered earth. So amazing was it all, so unlike anything they had previously experiied, that for a moment neither of them could think of anything to say. en Lucilla whispered, " I 'd no idea it would be as grand as this! " " Well, one thing 's for sure, we ca n't stand here all day. " " No. " He was right. Lucilla turned towards the first step, leading the ay. But before she had mounted the first step, the silence was broken by e sound of sharp heel-taps, hurrying along the terrace above them. " Darlings! " A figure appeared at the head of the stairs, arms outetched in welcome. " 1 heard the car. You 've come. And you 've not lost way. How clever you are and how perfect to see you, " Lucilla 's first impression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though at any moment she might blow away. bracing her was like holding a little bird. You did n't want to hug too 174 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER. p174 hard in case she snapped in two. Her hair was chestnut brown, swept back from her forehead and falling, in frondy curls, to her shoulders. Lucilla guessed that Pandora had worn her hair that way when she was eighteen and had never seen any reason to change the style. Her eyes were dark grey, shadowed by sooty black lashes, and her curving mouth full and sweet. On her right cheek, just above the corner of her upper lip, was a round dark beauty spot, too sexy to be called a mole. She was dressed in loose pyjamas of the brilliant pink of the hibiscus flowers, and there were gold chains around her neck and knots of gold in her ears. She smelled... Lucilla knew that scent. Poison. She had tried wearing it herself but could never decide whether she loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was still not certain. " I 'd have known you were Lucilla, even if nobody had told me. Yo look so like Archie.... " It seemed that she did not even notice thei unsavoury appearance, their soiled cut-off shorts and grubby T-shirt And if she did, she gave no indication of objecting. " And you must Jeff.... " She held out a pink-tipped hand. " How wonderful that yo could come with Lucilla. " He took it in his own enormous paw and, looking a bit overwhelm by her welcome and her dazzling smile, said, " Pleased to meet you. " She picked up his accent at once. " You 're an Australian! How hea enly. I do n't think I 've ever had an Australian here before. Did you ha a hideous drive? " " No. Not at all. Just hot. " " You must be longing for a drink.... " " Shall we get our stuff out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later. A drink first. Come along, I 've a friend here you to meet. " Lucilla 's heart sank. It did n't matter about Pandora, but they we certainly in no shape to be introduced to company. " Pandora, we ' dreadfully dirty.,.. " " Oh, heavens, that does n't matter. He wo n't mind... " She turn from them and led the way, and there was no alternative but to follow down a long shaded and airy terrace furnished with white cane an butter-yellow cushions and great blue-and-white porcelain jars plant with palms. " He ca n't stay for very long and I want you to m him.... " They turned the corner of the house and, hard on Pandora 's tappin heels, stepped out into blinding sunshine. Lucilla longed for her su glasses, left in the car. In a dazzle, she saw the wide, open terrace, shad p175 by striped awnings and paved in marble. Shallow steps led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowering trees and shrubs. Grass the were set with flagged stepping-stones, and these encircled a swimming pool, aquamarine and still as glass. Just seeing it made Lucilla feel ler. An inflatable sun-bed floated upon the surface of the water, drift-g with the undercurrent of the filter. At the far end of the garden, half hidden by hibiscus, she saw another use, small and single-storied, but with its own little terrace facing out ver the pool. This was shaded by a tall umbrella pine, and beyond the ' dge of its roof there was nothing to be seen but the brazen blue sky. " Here they are, Carlos, safely arrived. My directions ca n't have been as infusing as we 'd feared. " At the top of the steps, in the shade of the wning, stood a low table. On this was a tray with glasses and a tall jug. n ashtray, a pair of sunglasses, a paperback. More cane chairs, yellowshioned, stood about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of ese and stood, smiling, waiting to be introduced. He was tall and Barked and very handsome. " Lucilla, darling, this is my friend Carlos Maya. Carlos, this is Lucilla Blair, my niece. And Jeff...? " " Howland, " Jeff supplied for her. " And he 's Australian. Is n't that exciting? Now, let 's all sit down and ve a lovely drink. This is iced tea, but I can get Seraphina to bring mething stronger if you 'd like. Coke maybe? Or wine? " She began to ugh. " Or champagne? What a good idea. But perhaps a little early in e day. Let 's save the champagne till later. " They told her that iced tea would be perfect. Carlos drew forward a air for Lucilla and then settled himself beside her. But Jeff, who could k up sun like a lizard, went to lean on the balustrade of the terrace, d Pandora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandal dangling from a toe. Carlos Macaya poured iced tea and handed Lucilla her glass. " You have come from Ibiza? " " Yes, this morning, on the boat. " " How long were you there? " His English was perfect. " A week. Staying with a friend of Jeff 's. It was a lovely house but adfully primitive. Which is why we look so filthy. Because we are. I 'm rry. He made no comment on this ; simply smiled in an understanding way. And before Ibiza? " " I 've been in Paris. That 's where I met Jeff. I 'm meant to be a painter, t there was so much to see and so much to do, I did n't achieve very much. " p176 " Paris is a wonderful city. Was this your first visit? " " No, I 'd been once before. I spent some time as an au pair, to learn the language. " " And how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We thought of hitch-hiking but in the end we travelled by bus. We did the journey in stops and starts, staying in gites, and taking time to do some sightseeing. Cathedrals and wine chateaux -- that sort of thing. " " You have not been wasting your time. " He glanced at Pandora, chattering away to Jeff, who watched her intently as though she were some strange species of wildlife that he had never before observed. " Pandora tells me that this is the first time you have met each other. " " Yes. " Lucilla hesitated. This man was probably Pandora 's current lover, which meant that now was neither the time nor the place to enlarge on Pandora 's youthful elopement and subsequent life-style. " She was always abroad, you see. I mean, living abroad. " " And your home is in Scotland? " " Yes. In Relkirkshire. That 's where my parents live. " A small pause fell. She took a mouthful of iced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No. I studied in Oxford for a couple of years "( that explained his English), " but I never found time to go to Scotland. " " We 're always wanting Pandora to come back and see us, but she never will. " " Perhaps she does n't like the cold and the rain. " " It is n't cold and rainy all the time. Only some of the time. " He laughed. " Whatever. It is a splendid thing that you have come to keep her company. And now... " He pushed back his silk cuff and glanced at his watch. It was a handsome and unusual watch, the numbers marked by tiny replicas of yachting pennants, and was strapped to his wrist by a heavy gold bracelet. Lucilla wondered if Pandora had given it to him. Perhaps the pennants spelt out " I Love You " in naval code. "... it is time for me to take my leave. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do.... " " Of course.... " He rose once more to his feet. " Pandora, I must go. " " Oh dear, what a shame. " She fixed her sandal and hopped down off the balustrade. " Never mind, you 've had time to meet my guests. We 'll come and see you off. " " Do n't disturb everybody. " " They 've got to get their luggage anyway. They 're dying to unpack and have a swim. Come.... " She took his arm. And so they all made their way back to where his car was waiting in p177 the shade beneath the olive tree. Goodbyes were said, he sketched a kiss over the back of Pandora 's hand, and then got in behind the wheel of the BMW. He started up the engine, and Pandora stood back. But before he drove way, he said, " Pandora. " " Yes, Carlos? " " You will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She did not answer immediately, and then shook her head. " I sha n't hange my mind, " she told him. He smiled, shrugged resignedly, as though good-naturedly accepting er decision. He put the car into gear and, with a final wave, left them, riving away, through the gates, down the hill, out of sight. They stood siting until the sound of the BMW could be heard no longer. Only the ash of water from that unseen fountain, the tinkle of sheep bells. You will let me know if you change your mind What had Carlos been asking of Pandora? For an instant Lucilla toyed ith the idea that he had been proposing marriage, but almost at once ut this notion out of her head. It was too prosaic for such a sophistited and glamorous pair. More likely, he had been trying to persuade r to join him on some romantic trip, to the Seychelles or the palmnged beaches of Tahiti. Or perhaps he had simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like going. Whatever, Pandora was not about to enlighten them. Carlos was gone d now she sprang into practical activity, giving a little clap with her nds. " So. Down to business. Where 's your luggage? Is that all? No tcases or cabin trunks or hat-boxes? I take more than that if I go away r a single night. Now, come along.... " She started up the steps once more, going at a great pace, and yet again cy followed her, Lucilla carrying her leather satchel, and Jeff lugging e two bulging backpacks. " I 've put you in the guest-house. You can make yourselves at home, d then be quite independent. And I 'm not frightfully good in the morngs, so you 'll have to get your own breakfast. The fridge is full of goodand there 's coffee and stuff in the cupboard. " They were now back on terrace. " You 'll be all right? " " Of course. " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock. Just someng cold, because I ca n't cook to save my life, and Seraphina, my maid, home each evening. But she 'll leave everything ready for us. Come r at half past eight and we 'll have a drink. Now I 'm going to have a 178 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p178 little nap, so I 'll leave you to find your own way and settle yourselves in. Later, I might swim before I change for dinner. " The prospect of Pandora, dressed in an even grander outfit than the pink silk pyjamas, brought up the vexing question of clothes. " Pandora, we have n't got anything to change into. Nearly everything 's dirty. Jeff 's got one clean shirt, but it has n't been ironed. " " Oh, darling, do you want to borrow something? " " A clean T-shirt? " " Of course, how stupid of me, I should have offered. Wait a moment. " They waited. She disappeared through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and returned almost at once bearing a midnight-blue silk shirt splashed with a rocket-fall of sequins. " Have this, it 's frightfully vulgar but rather fun. You can keep it if you want, I never wear it. " She tossed it over and Lucilla caught it. " And now, off you go and dig yourselves into your little nest. If you want anything, ring through on the house phone and Seraphina will bring it to you. " She blew a kiss. " Half past eight. See you then. " And she was gone, leaving Lucilla and Jeff to their own devices. But still Lucilla hesitated, savouring the anticipation of what was about to happen next. " Jeff, I ca n't believe it. We 've got a whole house to ourselves. " " So what are we waiting for? If I do n't get into that pool in tw minutes flat, I 'm going to explode. " Lucilla went first, leading the way down the steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house awaited them. They crossed the terra and opened the door into a living-room. Curtains had been drawn, an Lucilla went to pull them back. Light streamed in and she saw the litt patio on the far side, the sheltered scrap of garden. " We 've even got our own place to sunbathe! " There was an open fireplace, stacked with logs. There were a few coma fortable chairs, a tray of drinks and glasses, a coffee-table stacked neat) with magazines, and a wall shelved with books. Opening other doo they found two double bedrooms, and a bathroom of marvellously s cious proportions. " I think this is the nicest bedroom. It 's certainly the biggest. " J dumped the backpacks onto the tiled floor and Lucilla drew back mo curtains. " We can see the sea from here. Just a little scrap, a triangle, but still a view of the sea. " She opened cupboard doors, saw rows of padded hangers, smelled lavender. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, where it hung in lonely style. Jeff had toed off his trainers and was stripping off his T-shirt. p179 " You can play house as much as you like. I 'm going to swim. You Joining me? " " I will in a moment. " He departed. An instant later she heard the splash as he took his running dive, and imagined the silken bliss of the cool water. But later. Just now she wanted to explore. On detailed inspection Pandora 's guest-house proved to be quite perfectly complete, and Lucilla was filled with admiration for such meticulous thought and planning. Someone... and who else but Pandora?... had somehow thought of anything that a visitor might want or need, from fresh flowers and lovely new books right down to spare blanets for chilly nights and hot-water bottles for possibly unsettled tumies. The bathroom was supplied with every sort of soap, scent, shamo, aftershave, body-lotion, and bath-oil. There were thick white bath wels and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door, a pair of oluminous and snowy-white towelling bathrobes. Leaving all this luxury, she crossed the sitting-room and went in arch of the kitchen, and found it sparkling neat, and lined with dark ooden cupboards filled with Spanish pottery, shining saucepans, casseles, and a complete batterie de cuisine. If one wanted -- which Lucilla id n't -- it would be quite possible to concoct a dinner party for ten. There were an electric cooker and a gas cooker and a dishwasher and a ridge. She opened the fridge and discovered there, along with all the xings for a robust breakfast, two bottles of Perrier water and a bottle of ampagne. A second door led out of the kitchen. She opened this and nd... joy of joys... a compact laundry with clothes washer, mg-lines, an ironing-board, and an iron. The sight of these homely s gave her more satisfaction than all the other luxuries put together. ause now, at last, they could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Went back to the bathroom, stripped her clothes, put on one of the towelling robes and then started in on unpacking. Which consisted of emptying the contents of the kpacks onto the bedroom floor. At the bottom of her own backpack e her wash-bag, her brush and comb, her sketch-pad, a book or two, the envelope from her father, which had contained his cheque, his r, and the invitation to a dance from Verena Steynton. She took this of the envelope and propped it on the empty dressing-table. By now it a bit dog-eared but bestowed, she decided, a personal note to the, as though Lucilla had put her name to it and claimed it as her p180 Lucilla Blair Mrs. Angus Steynton At Home For Katy Why did it seem so ludicrous? She laughed. Another life, another world away. She gathered up armfuls of dirty socks, shorts, jeans, pants, and T-shirts and headed back to the laundry. Without bothering to sort any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could see red socks going in with white shirts, but her mother was not here to remonstrate so what did it matter?) Lucilla stuffed the open face of the washingmachine, poured in detergent, slammed the door, and switched it on. Water gushed and the drum revolved, and she stood back and observed this with as much delight as if it had been a longed-for programme on television. Then she kicked aside the remainder of the dirty clothes, went to find her bikini, and joined Jeff in the pool. She swam for a long time. After a bit Jeff got out and lay in the sun to dry off. Another two lengths and she saw he was gone, had taken himself indoors. She came out of the pool and wrung the water from her long dark hair. She went indoors. She found him in the bedroom, flat out on one of the beds. He looked as though he might be going to sleep. She did not want him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a running jump, and landed flat on top of him. " Jeff. " " Yeah? " " I told you she was beautiful. " " Who? " " Pandora, of course. " Jeff did not immediately reply to this. He was drowsy and on the edge of sleep, and not inclined to conversation. H is arm, out-flung, pillowed Lucilla 's head. His skin smelled of chlorine and swimming pool. " Do n't you think she 's beautiful? " p181 " She 's certainly one sexy sheila. " " You think she 's sexy? " " But too old for me. " " She does n't look old. " " And a bit too skinny as well. " " Do n't you like skinny ladies? " " No. I like my women with big tits and fat bums. " Lucilla, who had inherited her shape from her father and was tall and thin and almost breastless, gave Jeff a thump with her fist. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, what do you want me to say? " " You know what I want you to say. " He pulled her face towards his own and kissed her soundly. " Will that do? " " I think you 'll have to shave that beard off. " " Now why should I do that? " " Because my face is going to start looking as though it 's been cleaned Off by sandpaper. " " I 'll have to stop kissing you then. Or start kissing you someplace here it does n't show. " They fell silent. The sun was dropping in the sky, and soon, quite ddenly, it would be dark. Lucilla thought of Scottish summer twilights at went on until midnight. She said, " Do you think they 're lovers? Do) u think they 're having a raging affair? " " Who? " " Pandora and Carlos Macaya. " " I would n't know. " " He 's terribly handsome. " " Yeah. A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Rather cosy. Easy to talk to. " " I liked his car. " " You have a one-track mind. What do you think it was he asked her? " " Come again? " He said, Let me know if you change your mind. ' And she said, I n't change my mind. ' He must have asked her something. He must have wanted her to do something with him. " " Well, whatever it was, she did n't look too bothered. " But Lucilla was not satisfied. " I 'm certain it was something terribly ificant. A turning-point in both their lives. " " You have a runaway imagination. More likely he was trying to fix a nis game. " 182 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p182 " Yes. " But somehow, Lucilla did not feel that this was so. She sighed, and the sigh turned into a yawn. " Perhaps. " At half past eight they were ready to join Pandora, and Lucilla decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look too bad. Both of them had showered and scrubbed and now smelled sweetly of the gratuitous shampoo. Jeff had neatened up his beard with a pair of nail scissors, and Lucilla had ironed his one clean shirt and salvaged from the pile of clothes on the laundry floor his tidiest pair of jeans. As for herself, she had washed her long dark hair and brushed it dry, pulled on a pair of black leggings, and now buttoned up the borrowed shirt. The heavy silk felt deliciously cool against her bare skin, and the sequined embroidery, viewed in the mirror through half-closed eyes, was not nearly as outrageous as she had first imagined. Perhaps it had something to do with these unaccustomed surroundings. Perhaps the ambience of enormous luxury helped absorb such small vulgarities. It was an interesting notion and one that she would have liked to discuss at lengt but right now there was no time. " Come on, " Jeff told her. " Time to be off. I need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed him, first making sure that all the lights in the guest-house were switched off. She was fairly certain that Pandora would not give a damn if every light was left burning, but, brought up by a thrifty Scottish mother, such small housewifely economies were engrained in Lucilla, as though her subconscious were a programmed computer. She found this strange, because later strictures had left as little impression as water on a duck 's back. Another interestin thought worth chewing over at a later date. Out of doors, they stepped into a blue night, star-bright and soft an warm as velvet. The garden was headily fragrant, the swimming poo floodlit, and lamps lit the way along the stepping-stones of the path. Lucilla heard the incessant chirp of the cicadas, and there was music coming from Pandora 's house. Rachmaninoff. The Second Piano Concerto. Banal, maybe, but perfect for just such a Mediterranean night. Pandora had set the scene and no she was waiting for them on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table beside her. p183 " There you are! " she called as they approached. " I 've already opened the champagne. I could n't wait any longer. " They went up the steps and into the pool of light that illuminated their hostess. She had changed into something black and cobwebby and wore gold sandals on her bare feet. The smell of Poison was even stronger than the scents of the garden. " Do n't you both look sleek! I ca n't think why you were so worried about yourselves. And Lucilla, the shirt is divine on you, you must keep it. Now, find chairs and settle down. Oh, blast, I 've forgotten the glasses. Lucilla, darling, go and get some, will you? The little bar 's just behind the door, you 'll find everything there. There 's a second bottle of bubbly in the fridge, but we 'll leave it there till we 've finished this one. Now, Jeff, you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear all about what you and Lucilla have been up to... " Lucilla left them and obediently went in search of the wineglasses, stepping indoors through wide, curtained doors. The bar was immediately at hand, no more than a large closet fitted with everything that any human being could need to fix a drink. She took two wineglasses from the shelf but did not at once return to the terrace. This was the first time she had actually been inside Pandora 's house, and she found herself in a room so spacious and spectacular that she was momentarily diverted from her errand. All was cool and creamy, sparked here and there with touches of brilliant colour. Sky-blue and turquoise cushions, and coralpink lilies massed in a square glass vase. Alcoves, cunningly lit, displayed a collection of Dresden figures and Battersea enamel. A plate-glass cof-fee-table was stacked with books and magazines, more flowers, a silver cigarette box. There was an open fireplace faced with blue-and-white tiles, and above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the room the dining-table--glass again -- was set for dinner with candles and crystal and yet more flowers, and to Lucilla 's bemused eyes it all seemed more like a stage set than a room designed for living in. And yet, she realized, there were homely touches too. An open paperback sed onto a sofa ; a half-finished tapestry lying close at hand for an empty moment. And there were photographs. Archie and Isobel on their wedding day. Lucilla 's grandparents, sweet old things in their tweeds, handing in front of Croy with their dogs beside them. Lucilla found these evidences of nostalgia immensely touching. For Some reason, she had not expected them, perhaps not imagining Pandora capable of such sentiment. Now she pictured Pandora taking them everywhere with her, all through her wayward love affairs and her turbulent nomad 's life. Saw her unpacking them from her suitcase in houses in 184 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p184 California, hotel bedrooms, apartments in New York and Paris. And now, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity upon yet another temporary home.( There did not seem to be any pictures of the men who had owned these apartments and occupied so much of Pandora 's life, but perhaps she kept those in her bedroom.) Warm dark breezes blew through the opened windows, and Rachmaninoff emanated from some unseen stereo, concealed by a gold-latticed trellis. The piano solo dripped its notes, pure as raindrops. From the terrace came the low murmur of comfortable conversation, Pandora and Jeff sounding peaceful and unimpatient. There were other photographs on the mantelpiece, and Lucilla crossed the floor to inspect these more closely. Old Lady Balmerino, resplendent in a feathered tam-o ' -shanter, apparently opening a village fete. A snapshot of Archie and Edmund Aird, two very young men sitting in the boat at the edge of the loch with their rods and their creels stowed on the thwarts. Finally, a studio portrait of herself and Hamish, Lucilla in smocked Liberty lawn and Hamish a fat baby on her knee. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his letters and she had framed it in silver and set it in the place of honour. Tucked into this silver frame was an invitation whose format was instantly familiar. Pandora Blair Mrs. Angus Steynton At Home For Katy Lucilla 's first thought was, how nice. And then, how ridiculous. A waste of a card, a waste of a stamp, because there was not the slightest possibility that Pandora would accept. She had gone from Croy when she was eighteen and never returned. Resisted all pleading, first from her parents, and then from her brother, and stayed resolutely away. It was scarcely likely that Verena Steynton, of all people, would achieve what Pandora 's own family had so abjectly failed to do, " Lucilla! " " Coming.. " What are you doing? " p185 Lucilla, bearing the wineglasses, joined them on the terrace. " Sorry. I 've been snooping round that beautiful room. And listening to the mutic... " " Oh, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of my most favourites. I know it 's a bit hackneyed, but I seem to go for hackneyed things. " " I 'm just the same, " Lucilla admitted. " Songs like Oh, Lovely Moon ' nd The Barcarolle ' leave me quite weak-kneed. And some of the old atles records. I 've got them all at home at Croy. And if I 'm feeling ally blue, I 've got a tape of a Fiddlers ' Rally in Oban and I play it and I n feel my spirits rise visibly, like mercury in a thermometer when ou 've got a temperature. All those dear old men and little boys in their Its and their shirt-sleeves, and an endless round of jigs and reels, as ough they did n't know how to stop and did n't want to anyway. I sually end up dancing all by myself and leaping around the room like an lot. " Jeff said, " I 've never seen you do that. " " Well, if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But seriusly, Pandora, this is the most beautiful place you 've got. And our uest-house is perfection. " " It is rather sweet, is n't it? I was so lucky to snap it all up. The people ho lived here before had to go back to England ; I was looking for mewhere to live and it seemed that it was just waiting for me. Jeff, ou 're meant to be pouring champagne... " " And the furniture? Is that all yours too? " Pandora laughed. " Oh, darling, I have n't got any furniture, just little is and pieces that I 've gathered on my travels and cart about with me, ost of the furniture here I took over with the house, but of course I 've anged almost everything. The sofas were the most hideous blue, and ere was a carpet with swirls on. Got rid of that pretty sharpish.

So there 's not really much point. " ll the glasses were now brimming full. Pandora raised hers. " Here 's to you both, and what heaven it is to have you here. Lucilla, s been telling me all about your journey down through France. How cinating it must have been. And you got to see Chartres, such an perience. I 'm longing to hear more, get all the details ; but first, and ost important, I want to be told all about home, and my precious chie and Isobel and Hamish. Hamish must be enormous now. And 186 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p186 Isobel, with those tedious Americans to stay. I hear all about them in Archie 's letters, when he is n't telling me about the latest grouse-bag, or the size of the salmon he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to do so much with that terrible leg. Tell me how the poor leg is. " " He ca n't actually do that much, " Lucilla told her bluntly. " He just writes you positive letters because he does n't want you to be upset. And his leg is n't anything. It 's tin, full stop. It ca n't get any better, and we all pray it 'll never get any worse. " " Poor darling. Beastly, beastly IRA. How they dare to do such things, and to Archie, of all people. " " They were n't necessarily gunning for him, Pandora. They were wait. ing, over the border, to blast off at a lot of British jocks, and he happened to be one of them. " " Did he know they were there? Or was it an ambush? " " I do n't know. And if I asked, he would n't tell me. He wo n't talk about it. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is that a good thing? " " I do n't suppose it is, but there 's not much we can do about it. " " He was never a great talker. The most darling man, but even as a, little boy he always kept everything to himself. We never even knew ht was courting Isobel, and when he told our mother that he wanted t marry her, Mama nearly dropped dead with astonishment because she ' got him lined up for some entirely different female. Never mind, sh made the best of it. Just as she always made the best of everything... Her voice faded. She fell silent, then swiftly emptied her glass. " Jeff, there any more left in that bottle, or shall we open another? " But the bottle was not yet empty and Jeff refilled Pandora 's glass, an then topped up Lucilla 's and his own. Lucilla was now beginning to f not only light-hearted but light-headed as well. She wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Perhaps the champagne was why she seemed to be talking so much. " Now tell me.. " She was off again. " What are the two of you going to do next? " Jeff and Lucilla looked at each other. Making plans was not one a! their strong points. Doing things on the spur of the moment was half the fun. It was Jeff who replied. " We do n't really know. Only thing is, I have go back to Australia at the beginning of October. I 've a flight book with Qantas on the third. " " Where do you fly from? " " London. " p187 " So, sometime, you 'll have to go back to England. " " Right. " " Is Lucilla going with you? " Again they looked at each other. " We have n't discussed it, " Lucilla said. " So you 're free. Free as air. Free to come and go as you wish. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture with her hand and illed some of her champagne. " Yes, " Jeff agreed cautiously, " I suppose it is. " " Then let us make plans. Lucilla, would you like to make plans with e? " " What sort of plans? " " When you were snooping, as you put it, around my drawing-room, id you notice that large and pretentious copperplate invitation on my mantelpiece? " " From Verena Steynton? Yes, I did. " " Have you been asked? " " Yes. Dad sent my invitation on to me and I got it in Ibiza. " " Are you going? " " I... I had n't actually thought about it. " " Might you go? " " I do n't know. Why? " " Because... " She laid down her glass. " I think that I shall go. " The shock of this announcement stunned Lucilla out of her delightful siness and into a state of cold sobriety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pandora stared back, her grey eyes with their huge black pils bright with a strange elation, as though delighting in the expressio-n of blank incredulity she had brought to Lucilla 's face. " You 'd go? " " Why not? " " Back to Scotland? " " Where else? " " For Verena Steynton 's dance? " It did not make sense. " It 's as good a reason as any " " But you 've never come before. Dad asked you and begged you, and ' ve never come. He told me. " " There has to be a first time. Perhaps now is the right time. " All at e she stood up and walked away from them to stand looking out over garden. She stayed there for an instant, quite still, silhouetted against light that shone upwards from the pool. Her dress, her hair moved in breeze. Then she turned to face them, leaning against the balustrade. P p188 She said, and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been thinking so much about Croy. Just lately, I 've been thinking so much about it. I 'd dream about it, and wake up, and start remembering things I had n't thought of in years. And then the invitation came. Like yours, Lucilla, forwarded on from Croy. And it brought back a million memories of the fun we used to have at those ridiculous dances and hunt balls. And house parties, and the hills ringing with the crack of guns, and every evening an enormous dinner party. How my poor mother coped with us all, I can not imagine. " She smiled at Lucilla, and then at Jeff. " And you two arriving. Phoning from Palma and turning up out of the blue, and Lucilla so like Archie. Omens. Do you believe in omens, Lucilla? " " I do n't know. " " Neither do I. But I 'm certain, with the Highland blood that courses through our veins, that we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the foot-rest, her face close to Lucilla 's. Beneath the beauty, Lucilla could discern the years stamped on Pandora 's lovely features : the lines around her eyes and mouth, the papery skin, the sharp angle of her jawbone. " So, let us make plans. Will you both make plans with me? Would you mind if I asked you to do that thing? " Lucilla looked across at Jeff. He shook his head. She said, " We would n't mind. " " Then this is what we 'll do. We 'll stay here for a week, just the three of us, and you shall have the time of your lives. And then we 'll take my car, and we 'll catch the ferry to Spain. And we 'll drive through Spain and France, taking our time and making a pleasure of the journey. When we get to Calais, we 'll cross over to England. And we 'll head north, and we 'll go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Croy. Oh, Lucilla, say you think it 's a wonderful idea. " " It 's certainly totally unexpected, " was all Lucilla could come up with, but if Pandora noticed a certain lack of enthusiasm in her voice, she gave no indication of doing so. Swept along on her own excitement, she turned to Jeff. " And you? How does it sound to you? Or do you think I 'm out o(? my mind? " " No. " " You would n't mind coming to Scotland with us? " " If that 's what you and Lucilla want, I 'd be delighted. " " Then it 's all settled! " She was triumphant. " We 'll all stay at Croy with Isobel and Archie, and we 'll all go to the Steyntons ' lovely party. " " But Jeff has n't been asked, " Lucilla pointed out. " Oh, that 's no problem. " " And he wo n't have anything to wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, you do disappoint me. I thought you were an unworldly artist, and all you seem to do is worry bout clothes!

All done. All that remained were those rments which required that the name-tapes be hand-sewn... rugger ckings, an overcoat, and a grey polo-necked pullover, but these could done at leisure, in the evening, and by the fireside. She had not had such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years ago, but he had grown during the summer lidays to such an alarming extent that she had been forced to wheel into Relkirk, school-clothes list in hand, and start all over again. The pedition, as she had known it would be, had been both painful and pensive. Painful because Hamish did not want to think about going k to school, hated shopping, hated new clothes, and miserably reted being done out of a single day of his holiday freedom. And expen-e because the regulation uniform could only be purchased at the most market and costly shop in the town. The overcoat, the polo-necked ter, and the rugger stockings were bad enough, but five new pairs of rmous leather shoes were almost more than Isobel, and her bank ance, could take. With some idea of cheering Hamish up, she had bought him an icem, but he had devoured this morosely and without joy, and they had urned to Croy in an uncommunicative and mutually unfriendly si-. Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his trout rod, and wearing an expression which implied that he had grossly mistreated. Isobel was left to hump the parcels and boxes airs, where she had slung them into the foot of his wardrobe and 194 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p194 firmly shut the door, then made her way to the kitchen to boil a kettle for a cup of tea and start preparing dinner. The horrible experience of spending vast quantities of money that she could not afford left her feeling quite sick, and Hamish 's patent ingratitude did not help. Peeling potatoes, she said a silent goodbye to an dreams of buying herself a new dress for the Steyntons ' dance. The of. navy taffeta would have to do. Letting herself feel martyred and ill don by, she toyed with the notion of freshening it up with a touch of white : the neck. But that had all happened two weeks ago, and now September here. That made everything better, and for a number of reasons. most important was that, until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of paying guests. Scottish Country Tours had shut up shop for t winter, and the last lot of Americans, complete with baggage, souveni and tartan bonnets, had been waved away. The tiredness and depressi that had dogged Isobel all summer was dissolved almost instantly by h sense of freedom and the knowledge that, once more, she and Archie h Croy to themselves. But this was not all. Born and bred in Scotland, she experienced e. year this lifting of the spirits as August slipped away, off the calen, : and one could stop pretending that it was summer. Some years, it true, there came seasons like the old days, when the lawns grew dry fr ' lack of rain and golden evenings were spent watering the roses and sw - peas and the rows of young lettuces in the vegetable garden. But t frequently the months of June, July, and August were nothing but a lo and soggy endurance test of frustration and disappointment. Grey ski chill winds, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saint. The worst were those dark and muggy days when, in desperate one eventually retreated indoors and lit a fire, whereupon the sky instantly cleared and the late afternoon sun dazzled out over the sod? garden, tantalizingly too late to be of use to anybody. This summer, in particular, had been specially disappointing, and wi hindsight Isobel realized that the weeks of dark clouds and sunlessned had done much to contribute to her low spirits and physical exhaust ' The first snap of frost was actually welcome, and she was able to p195 away her cotton skirts and shirts with some satisfaction and revert once more to friendly old tweeds and Shetland pullovers. But even after splendid summers, September in Relkirkshire was special. Those first light frosts cleared the air, so that the colours of the countryside took on a stronger and richer hue. The deep blue of the skies was reflected in loch and river, and with the harvest safely in, the fields tood golden with stubble. Harebells grew in wayside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloom, stained the hills with purple. And then, most important of all, September meant fun. A packed ason of socializing before the darkness of a long winter closed in on em all, when the bitter weather and snow-packed roads isolated scatred communities and precluded any form of contact. September meant ople. Friends. For this was when Relkirkshire came truly into its own. By the end of July, the last of the annual invasion of holiday-makers d, by and large, left ; tents were packed up and caravans towed away, as e tourists headed for home. In their stead, August brought the vanard of a secondary immigration from the south, regular visitors who turned each year to Scotland for the sport and the parties. Shooting ges that had stood forlornly empty for most of the year were once ore opened up, and their owners, driving north up the motorway in nge Rovers loaded to the gunwales with rods, guns, small children, nagers, friends, relations, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, local households swelled, not with Americans nor paying gists but with the young families who belonged to these establishments d had, by necessity, moved south to London to live and work, saving cir yearly vacations to return home at just this time. All bedrooms were upied, attics turned into temporary accommodation for gangs of ndchildren, and sparse bathrooms worked overtime. Huge quantities food were produced, cooked, and eaten every day at dining-room ta-s elongated by extra leaves. And then, September. In September, all at once, everything came to, as though some celestial stage-manager had made his countdown d pulled the switch. The Station Hotel in Relkirk was transformed m its customary Victorian gloom to a cheerful, crowded meeting-place old friends, and the Strathcroy Arms, taken over by the syndicate of sinessmen who paid Archie reassuring sums of money for the privilege shooting grouse over his moor, fairly buzzed with activity and sporting At Croy, ' the invitations stood stacked on the mantelpiece in the liry, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROSAMUNDE FILCHER p196 tion to the general jollity was an annual buffet lunch party before the Strathcroy Games. Archie was Chieftain of these Games and led the opening parade of village worthies, their stride tactfully slowed to match his halting gait. For this important ceremony, he wore his regimental balmoral and carried a drawn sword. He took his responsibilities with great solemnity and, at the end of the day, presented prizes, not only for piping and Highland dancing but also for the sweater most expertly knitted from hand-spun wool, the lightest of sponge cakes, and the winning pot of home-made strawberry jam. Isobel kept her sewing-machine in the old linen room at Croy, mostly for reasons of convenience but also because it was her favourite and most private retreat. Not large, but quite spacious enough, it had windows facing west, out over the croquet lawn and the road that led up to the loch, and on bright days was always filled with sunshine. The curtains were white cotton, the floor brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cupboards in which were stowed all the household sheets and towels and spare blankets and fresh bed-covers. The solid table on which stood the sewing-machine was also useful for cutting out and dressmaking, and the ironing-board and the iron stood ready for instant use. As well, there was always a comforting nursery smell of laundered linen and the lavender bags that Isobel tucked in with her crisp piles of pillowcases, and this contributed in no small way to create an extraordinary aura of timelessness and tranquillity. Which was why, with the name-tapes finished, she made no immediate effort to move but stayed, sitting on the hard chair, with her elbows on the table and her chin in her hands. The view beyond the open window led, up beyond the trees, to the first gentle summits of the hills. All was washed in golden sunlight. The curtains stirred in the breeze, and that same breath of air shivered through the branches of the silver birches that stood on the far side of the lawn. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was half past three and she was alone in the house. Indoors all was still, but from the farmyard she heard distant hammering and the barking of one of the dogs. For once in her life she had time to herself, there being no commitment nor person urgently requiring her attention. She could scarcely remember when she had last found herself in such a situation, p197 197 and her thoughts drifted back to childhood and youth and the lazy, aimless joys of empty days. A floor creaked. Somewhere a door slammed shut. Croy. An old house with a heartbeat all its own. Her home. But she remembered the day, over twenty years ago, when Archie had first brought her here. She was nineteen and a tennis party had been arranged, with afternoon tea served in the dining-room. Isobel, the daughter of an Angus solicitor, and neither beautiful nor assured, had found herself overwhelmed by the size and grandeur of the place, and as well by the glamour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom seemed to know each other frighteningly well. Already hopelessly in love with Archie, she could not imagine why he had bothered to include her in the general invitation. Lady Balmerino appeared to be equally perplexed, but had been kind, making certain Isobel sat next to her at the tea-table, and taking pains to see that she was not left out of any conversation. But there was another girl, long-legged and blonde, who seemed already to have claimed Archie for her own, and made this very clear to e assembled company, teasing him, and catching his eye across the ble as though they shared a million private secrets. Archie, she was! ling them all, belonged to her, and no other person would be permitted take possession. But, at the end of the day, Archie had made up his own mind to marry Sobel. His parents, once they had got over their astonishment, were tently delighted and welcomed Isobel into the family not as Archie 's ife but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny, hospitale, unworldly, and totally charming, the Balmerinos were adored by erybody and Isobel was no exception. From the farm, she heard one of the tractors starting up. Another leaf uttered to the ground. It occurred to Isobel that now could be an after-n that had happened long ago, as though time had slipped backwards. e sort of afternoon when dogs sought for shade, and cats basked on ndow-sills, their furry bellies turned to the sun. She thought of Mrs. Harris, with one of the younger maids in tow, emerging from the kitchen d headed for the walled garden, there to fill a bowl with the last of the pberries, or reach for the bloomy Victoria plums, capturing their eetness before the wasps got at them. A11 of Croy the way it once had been. Nobody had gone away. Nobody died. They were still alive, those two dear old people ; Archie 's ther out with her roses, snipping away at the dead heads and finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raked the dusty gravel ; Archie 's father in the library, stealing a little snooze with his silk 198 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p198 handkerchief spread across his face. Isobel only had to go and find them. She imagined doing this, making her way down the stairs, crossing the hall to stand at the open front door. She saw Lady Balmerino in her straw gardening hat coming in from the garden, carrying the basket filled with snippings and faded rose petals. But when she looked up and saw Isobel, she would frown and show some confusion because the middleaged Isobel would be unfamiliar to her as a ghost.... " Isobel! " The voice, raised, impinged upon her daydreams. Isobel was aware that it had already called, more than once, but she had scarcely heard. Who was wanting her now? Reluctantly she collected herself, push back the chair and got to her feet. Perhaps to be left alone for more th five minutes was too much to expect. She went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the stairs. Leaning over the bannister she saw below her the foreshortened view of Verena Steynton standing the middle of the hall, having walked into the house through the o front door. " Isobel! " " I 'm here. " Verena tilted her head and looked up. " I was beginning to think th was nobody in. " " Only me. " Isobel started down the stairs. " Archie 's taken Hami and the dogs to the Buchanan-Wrights ' cricket match. " " Are you busy? " Verena did not look as though she had been busy. usual, she was immaculately and suitably turned out, and surely had just been to the hairdresser. " I 've been sewing Hamish 's name-tapes for school. " Instinctively, Isobel put a hand to her hair, as though the casual gesture might improve her own tousled head. " But I 've finished now. " " Can you spare me a moment? " " Of course. " " I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I meant to phone b I 've been in Relkirk all day and then, driving home, I thought it much simpler and nicer just to call in. " " Do you want a cup of tea? " " In a moment. No hurry. " " Let 's go and be comfortable. " Isobel led her visitor into the drawingroom, not with any intentions of grandeur but simply because it was full of sunlight, and the library and the kitchen, at this time of day, were inclined to be gloomy. The windows stood open, the room felt cool, and a p199 mass of sweet peas, which Isobel had picked that morning and arranged in an old soup tureen, filled the air with their fragrance. " Heaven. " Verena sank into a corner of the sofa and stretched out her long and elegantly shod legs. " What a day for the cricket match. Last year it bucketed with rain and they had to pull stumps in the middle of the afternoon because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peas? What colours! Mine were a bit of a failure this year. Do you know I really hate Relkirk on a warm afternoon? The pavements were banked three deep with fat girls in jeans pushing babies in buggies. And all the babies seemed to be howling. " " I know the feeling. How 's everything going? " She had already made up her mind that Verena wanted to talk about the dance and she was not mistaken. " Oh... " Verena, for a moment, became quite dramatic, groaning as though in pain and closing her eyes. " I 'm beginning to wonder why I ever thought about throwing a party. Do you know half the invitations have n't even been answered yet? People are so thoughtless. I think they leave them curling on mantelpieces, waiting to die of old age. It makes trying to arrange dinner parties and find beds for everybody quite impos-ible. " " I would n't worry. " Isobel tried to sound soothing. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But that would mean utter chaos. " Isobel knew that it would n't, but Verena was a perfectionist. " Yes, I uppose so. It must be awful. " She added, almost afraid to ask, " Has Lucilla replied yet? " " No, " Verena told her bluntly. " We did send your invitation on, but she 's travelling so she may not en have got it. She sent us a rather vague address in Ibiza, but we ve n't heard from her since she was in Paris. She thought she might go d see Pandora. " " I have n't heard from Pandora either. " " I 'll be surprised if you do. She never answers anything. " " But Alexa Aird 's coming, and bringing a boyfriend. Did you know at Alexa has found herself a man? " " Vi told me. " " Extraordinary. I wonder what he 's like. " " Virginia says he 's dishy. " " Ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katy arriving? " " Next week sometime. She called last night. Which is one of the 200 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p200 favours that I have to ask you. Have you got a houseful of people staying over the dance? " " So far, nobody. Hamish will be back at school and I do n't know whether Lucilla will be here or not.... " " Well, could you be an angel and have a stray man to stay? Katy told me about him last night. She met him at some dinner party, and liked him. He 's an American -- a lawyer, I think -- but his wife 's just died, and he 's come over here for a bit of a holiday. He 's coming to Scotland anyway to stay with some people who live in the Borders, and she thought it would be friendly to send him an invitation. We ca n't put him up at Corriehill because I 'm full, with all Katy 's friends, and Toddy Buchanan has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought you could give him a bed? Would you mind? I do n't know anything abou him except the bit about his wife dying, but if Katy liked him I don suppose he 'd be dreadfully heavy weather. " " Poor man. Of course he can come. " " And you 'll bring him to the party? You are sweet. I 'll ring Katy tonight, and tell her to tell him to get in touch with you. " " What 's his name? " " Something funny. Plucker. Or... Tucker. That 's it. Conr Tucker. Why do you suppose Americans always have such peculi names? " Isobel laughed. " They probably think Balmerino 's pretty odd. Wh else is happening? " " Nothing really. We 've persuaded Toddy Buchanan to do the cateri and run the bar, and produce some sort of a breakfast. For some reaso Katy 's generation are always ravenously hungry around four in t morning. And darling Tom Drystone is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be a party without our whistling postman up on t platform. Are you having a disco? " " Yes. A young man from Relkirk is doing that. He produces every thing. A sort of job lot. Flashing lights and amplifiers. What the noise going to be like, I dread to think. And we 're going to have fairy lights the way up the drive. I thought it would look festive, and if it 's a miser ably dark evening, it 'll help people find the way. " " It 'll look wonderful. You 've thought of everything. " " Except flowers. That 's the other favour I 've got to ask you. Wou you help with the flowers? Katy will be there, and I 've press-ganged o or two others, but nobody does flowers the way you do, and I 'd endlessly grateful if you 'd help. " p201 Isobel felt flattered. It was nice to think that there was something that could do better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing is, " Verena went on before Isobel had a chance to speak, " I ' t think how to decorate the marquee. The house is n't so difficult, but marquee presents something of a problem because it 's so enormous d ordinary flower arrangements would simply be dwarfed. What do u think? You 're always full of bright ideas. " Isobel searched for a bright idea but drew a blank. " Hydrangeas? " " They 'll be over by then. " " Hire some potted palms. " " Too depressing. Like the ballroom of some provincial hotel. " " Well, why not make it really countrified and seasonal? Sheaves of ripe ley and branches of rowan. Lovely red berries and those pretty leaves. d the beeches will be turning as well. We can soak the stems in glycerand simply cover the tent-poles, make them look like autumn s. " " Oh, a brainwave. You 're brilliant. We 'll do it all the day before the y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your diary? " " It 's Vi 's birthday picnic that day, but I can give that a miss. " " You 're a saint. What a weight off my mind. The relief of it. " Verena tched luxuriously, swallowed a yawn, fell silent. The clock on the mantelpiece ticked gently, and the quiet of the room ed in on the two women. Yawns were catching. And it was a mistake er to sit down in the middle of the afternoon because you did n't feel ever getting up again. Summer afternoons and nothing in particular do. Once more Isobel drifted back into that illusion of timelessness in ich she had been lost before Verena 's interruption. She thought again old Lady Balmerino, who used to sit here, as she and Verena sat, ding a novel or peacefully sewing her tapestry. Everything now as e it had been. Perhaps in a moment there would come a discreet tap the door and Harris the butler would enter, pushing before him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggshell china cups ; covered dishes of scones, fresh from the oven, the bowl of cream, the wberry jam, the lemon sponge-cake, and the dark, sticky gingerbread. The clock, with silvery notes, struck four, and the illusion dissolved. rris was long gone and would never return. Isobel yawned again and, with some effort, pulled herself to her feet. " I 'll go and put the tle on, " she told Verena, " and we 'll have that cup of tea. " p202 Friday the Ninth.. THAT WAS THE YEAR my cousin Flora had her bairn. Did yo know her parents? Uncle Hector was my father 's brother, much younger of course, and married to a girl from Rum.

"... went into service when I was fourteen, over in a big house Fife ; I cried buckets, but my mother said I had to go. I was the kitch maid and the Cook was a bisom ; I 've never been so tired in my life, up five o'clock in the morning and slept in the attic with a moose. " This at least caught Violet 's attention.

A fisherman, up to his hips in water, flogged his salmon rod. far he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Across the river ood large Victorian houses, deep in spacious gardens with lawns that n down to the water. One or two had little boats moored. There were ucks on the water. A man, passing with his dog, threw crusts and the ucks came gobbling, squabbling, to snatch the crusts up.... the doctor said it was a stroke, said she 'd got nerves. I wanted to and be a volunteer, with the war on and everything, but if I 'd gone ere 'd be no one to stay with my mother. My father was a worker out of ors, he grew lovely turnips, but indoors, sit down and take off his boots d that was it... never seen a man who could eat so much.

Filthy things Violet, having made her promise to Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an afternoon, had suffered an uneasy conscience until e had finally decided to take the plunge and get it over, and had invited tie to come shopping with her in Relkirk and to have high tea. She ad duly collected Lottie from Edie 's cottage, packed her into the car, nd driven her into the town. For the occasion Lottie had dressed in her st, a beige Crimplene coat and a hat the shape of a cottage loaf. She rried a huge handbag and wore her tottery high-heeled shoes. From the oment she got into the car, she had not stopped talking. She had talked they made their way around Marks and Spencer, talked as they waited the queue to buy fresh vegetables, talked as they searched the crowded reets for what Lottie insisted on calling a haberdasher 's. " I do n't think there are any haberdasher 's any longer, Lottie.... " " Oh, yes, a little one down that street... or was it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Never believing they would find it, Violet allowed herself to be led and in circles, getting more hot and footsore by the moment, and was rn between annoyance and relief when Lottie finally ran the shop to rth. It was very old and dusty, and crammed with a collection of rdboard boxes containing crochet hooks, faded embroidery silks, and t-of-date knitting patterns. The old woman behind the counter looked though she had just managed to make it out of a geriatric home, and it k her fifteen minutes to find what Lottie wanted, which was a yard of 204 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p204 boiling knicker elastic. Finally, however, it was produced from a drawer filled with odd buttons, put shakily into a paper bag, and paid for. They stepped out onto the pavement, and Lottie was triumphant. " Told you so, " she crowed to Violet. " Did n't believe me, did you? " With their shopping over and it not yet being time for tea, Violet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made their way back to her car, dumped their purchases in the boot, and then crossed the wide sward of grass that led to the river. At the first bench, Violet had firmly sat down. " We 'll have a little rest, " she told Lottie, and so here they were, side by side in the golden sunshine, and Lottie still with plenty to say. " That 's the Relkirk Royal, that 's where I was, you can just see it through the trees. Nice enough place, but I could n't stand the nurses. The doctor was good enough, but no more than a young student, do n't imagine he knew anything, although he pretended he did. Lovely gardens, though, just as nice as the Cremmy. I wanted Mother cremated, but the minister said she wanted to lie by my father in the churchyard at Tullochard. Though I do n't know how he should know more than me. " " I expect your mother told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, always liked to interfere. " Violet looked across the river to where the Relkirk Royal stood hi on the hill, its red stone turrets and gables scarcely visible through th leafy trees that surrounded it. She said, " The hospital certainly has lovely position. " " That 's doctors for you. They can pay for anything. " Casually, " What was he called, the young doctor who took care you? " " Dr. Martin. There was another, Dr. Faulkner, but he never came n me. It was Dr. Martin who said I could go and live with Edie. I wanted taxi but it was an ambulance. " " Edie is very kind. " " She 's had a good enough life, some people have all the luck. Different living in a village to being stuck away up the hill. " " Perhaps you could sell your parents ' house and move into a village? " But Lottie ignored this sensible suggestion and went on, full flood, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Violet then that Lottis ' was more astute than any of them suspected. " Worry about her being so fat, it 's a heart attack she 'll have one morning, carrying all that flab around with her. And always flying out of the house, off to your house Virginia 's, never sits down for a bit of peace or a chat or to watch t telly. Ought to think of herself sometimes. She told me that Alexa ' coming up for Mrs. Steynton 's party. Bringing a friend. That 's nice, isn p205 It? But you 'll need to watch, men are all the same, after what they can get their hands on.... " " What do you mean, Lottie? " Violet was sharp. Lottie turned dark round eyes upon her. " Well, she 's no pauper, is Alexa. Old Lady Cheriton was never short of sixpence. I read the newspapers, know all about that family. Nothing like a bit of cash to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Violet found herself assailed by a helpless rage that seemed to surge up from the soles of her feet and, reaching her cheeks, burn them red. Rage at Lottie 's impertinence, and helplessness because Lottie was, after all, only voicing what all Alexa 's family, obscurely, feared. She said, " Alexa is very pretty and very dear. The fact that she is also independent has nothing to do with the friends she chooses. " But Lottie either ignored or missed the snub. She gave a little laugh, tossing her head. " I would n't be too sure about that. And coming from London, too. Lot of money grubbers. Yuppies, " she added with some force, saying the word as though it were dirty. " Lottie, I do n't think you know what you 're talking about. " " All these girls are the same. Always were, see a handsome man and they 're away like a bitch in heat. " She shivered suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every nerve-end of her gangling ame. Then she put out a hand and closed it over Violet 's wrist. " That 's another thing. Henry. See him about the place. He 's small, is n't he? Comes to Edie 's and never says a word. Looks funny to me sometimes. I 'd worry if I were you. Not like other little boys... " Her bony fingers were strangely strong, the grip viselike. Violet, re-I led, knew an instant of panic. Her immediate instinct was to prize the ngers loose, get to her feet and escape, but just then a girl walked by ushing a child in a buggy, and common sense came to Violet 's rescue. re panic, the annoyance faded. It was, after all, just poor Lottie Carirs, to whom life had not been kind, letting her sad, sexual frustrations d her rambling imagination run away with her. And if Edie could nd having her cousin to live with her, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled. She said, " It 's good of you to be concerned, Lottie, but my is a very ordinary little boy and sound as a bell. Now... " She fted slightly, glancing at her watch, and felt Lottie 's fingers loosen r manic grip and slip away. Violet, unhurried, reached for her hand-.. I think it 's time we went and found somewhere pleasant to have our tea. I 'm feeling quite peckish. I fancy fish and chips. How about p206 AS ISOBEL, WORN OUT WITH the daily demands of her busy life, retreated from time to time to the linen room, so her husband found solace in his workshop. This was in the basement of Croy, an area of stone-flagged passages and dimly lighted cellars. The old boiler lived down here, a brooding, smelly monster that looked large enough to drive a liner, and demanded constant and regular attention and enormous quantities of coke. As well, one or two other rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items of furniture, the coal and the logs, and a much-diminished wine cellar. But mostly, the basement stood deserted, hung with cobwebs and invaded each year by families of field mice. The workshop was next door to the boiler room, which meant that it was always pleasantly warm, and it had large windows, barred like a jail 's, which faced south and west and let in sufficient light for cheerfulness. Archie 's father, neat with his hands, had set it all up, with heavy benches, racks for tools, vises, and clamps. And it was here that the old man had liked to potter, repairing his children 's damaged toys, dealing with various inevitable breakages that occurred about the house, and concocting his own salmon flies. After he died, the workshop had stood empty for some years, unused, neglected, and gathering dust. But when Archie came back to Croy after his eight months in hospital, he painfully made his way down the stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took repossession. The first thing he saw as he entered the room was a broken balloon-back chair, its back legs shattered by the weight of some corpulent occupant. It had been brought down to the workshop before old Lord Balmerino died. He had made a start on its repair but never finished the job, and the chair had been left, forgotten and untended, ever since. Archie stood and looked at the forlorn piece of furniture for some p207 time. Then he shouted for Isobel. She came. She helped him sweep away the dirt and the cobwebs and the mouse droppings and the drifts of old sawdust. Scuttling spiders were sent packing, as were solidified pots of glue, piles of yellowed newspapers, ancient tins of paint. Isobel cleaned the windows and somehow forced them open, letting in the sweet fresh air. Meanwhile Archie, having wiped and oiled all the fine old tools, the chisels and hammers, saws and planes, replaced them in orderly fashion in their racks. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a list of all that he needed, and Isobel went into Relkirk and bought it for him. Only then was he able to get down to work and finish the job that his father had started. Now he sat at that same bench, the afternoon sun slanting through the top half of the window, and finished priming the carving he had been working on, from time to time, over the last month or two. It was about ten inches high and depicted the figure of a girl sitting on a boulder with a small Jack Russell terrier leaning against her knee. The girl wore a sweater and a kilted skirt, and her hair was windblown. It was, in fact, Katy Steynton and her dog. Verena had given Archie a photograph of her daughter, taken up on the moor last year, and from this he had made the drawings for the carving. With the primer dry, he would paint it, reproducing as closely as possible the muted colours of the photograph. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-first birthday present. It was done. He laid down the brush and leaned back in his chair to stretch the aches out of his limbs, and assess his creation over the top of his half-moon spectacles. He had never before attempted the complications of a sitting figure, and a female one at that, and was inordinately pleased with the way it had turned out. Girl and dog made a charming composition. Tomorrow he would paint it. He looked forward with some satisfaction to applying the final touches. From upstairs, he heard the faint sound of the telephone ringing. It was only just audible, and for months he and Isobel had been talking about the sense of installing another bell in the basement so that he could hear the sound more easily, should he be alone in the hbuse. But they had done nothing about this and he was alone in the house now, and wondered how long the telephone had been ringing, and if there was time for 208 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p208 him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the caller, losing heart, hung up. He thought about ignoring it but the ringing continued. Perhaps it was important. He pushed back his chair and made his slow way down the passage and up the stairs to answer the wretched instrument. The nearest receiver was in the kitchen and it was still ringing shrilly as Archie crossed over to the dresser and picked it up. " Croy. " " Dad! " " Lucilla! " His heart leaped with joy. He reached for a chair. " Where were you? The phone 's been ringing for hours. " " Down in my workshop. " He settled himself ', taking the weight off his leg. " Oh, I 'm sorry. Is Mum not there? " " No. She and Hamish have gone blackberrying. Lucilla, where are you? " " I 'm in London. And you 'll never guess where I 'm ringing from. You 'll never guess in a thousand years. " " In that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ritz. " " What the hell are you doing there? " " Staying the night. And then we 're driving up tomorrow. We 'll be home tomorrow night. " Archie took off his spectacles ; he could feel the grin of delight spreading over his face. " Who 's we '? " " Jeff Howland and me. And... wait for it.. Pandora. " " Pandora? " " I thought that would surprise you.... " " But what 's Pandora doing with you? " " She 's coming home. She says it 's for Verena Steynton 's dance, but I suspect it 's really to see Croy and all of you again. " " Is she there now? " " No. She 's having a toes-up. I 'm phoning from my room. I 'm all alone except for Jeff. I 've got so much to tell you and Mum, but I wo n't do it now because it 's all so complicated... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " When did you get to London? " " This morning. Just before lunch. We 've all been driving through Spain and France in Pandora 's car. We 've had the most amazing time. Then we caught the ferry early this morning and came to London. I was all ready to head north right away, but Pandora wanted to draw breath, so she brought us here. Insisted. And do n't worry about the bill because p209 she 's footing it. She footed the whole trip, ever since we left Palma. Paid for all the petrol, the hotels, everything. " " How,.. " His voice broke. It was ridiculous, unmanly, to be so emotional. He tried again. " How is she? " " She 's fine. Terribly pretty. Lots of fun. Oh, Dad, you are pleased I 'm bringing her home, are n't you? It 's not going to be too much for Mum? Pandora 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'll ever raise a finger to do anything to help, but she 's so excited about seeing you both again. It will be all right, wo n't it? " " More than all right, my darling. It 's like a miracle. " " And do n't forget, I 'm bringing Jeff as well. " " We look forward to meeting him. " " See you tomorrow then. " " What time? " " About five? But do n't worry if we 're a little late. " " We wo n't. " " I ca n't wait. " " Nor me. Drive carefully, my darling. " " Of course. " She sent him a kissing noise down the hundreds of miles of wire, and rang off. Archie was left sitting on the hard kitchen chair and holding the buzzing receiver in his hand. Lucilla and Pandora. Coming home. He replaced the receiver. The buzzing ceased. The old kitchen clock ticked slowly. For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then got to his feet and went out of the kitchen and down the passage to his study. Sitting at his desk, he opened a drawer and took out a key. Using this key, he opened another, smaller drawer. From this he withdrew an envelope, yellowed with the years and addressed in Pandora 's large and immature scrawl to himself, at the Headquarters of The Queen 's Loyal Highlanders, in Berlin. The date of the postmark was 1967. It contained a letter, but he did not take this letter out to read because he knew it by heart. Which meant that there was no reason why he had never torn it to shreds, nor flung it on a fire, except that he could not bring himself to destroy it. Pandora. Coming back to Croy. From the distance came the sound of a car, growing louder, approaching the house, up the hill from the main road. The noise of its engine was unmistakable. Isobel and Hamish returning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envelope back into its drawer, locked it away, disposed once more of the key, and went to meet them. 210 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p210 Isobel had driven the minibus around the back of the house and parked it in the yard and, by the time Archie returned to the kitchen, they were there, his wife and his son, flinging open the door and staggering triumphantly through it, each weighed down by two huge baskets brimming with dark fruit. After a session in the bramble thickets they were both disreputable, dirty, and mud-stained, and looked, Archie decided fondly, no better than a pair of tinkers. Every time he set eyes on Hamish, he knew a small shock of surprise, because the boy, these summer holidays, had grown like a young tree, getting taller and larger by the day. At twelve, he now topped his mother, and his out-at-elbow sweater was strained across a pair of muscular shoulders. His shirt hung out of his jeans, purple juice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair was sorely in need of a cut. Archie, eyeing him, was filled with pride. " Hi, Dad. " Dumping the baskets onto the kitchen table, Hamish groaned. " I 'm starving. " " You 're always starving. " Isobel, too, set down her load. " Hamish, you 've been eating blackberries all afternoon. " She wore her baggy corduroys and a shirt that Archie had long since discarded. " You ca n't be hungry. " " I am. Blackberries do n't fill you up. " Hamish was headed for the dresser where the cake tins were stacked. He removed a lid with a clatter and reached for a knife. Archie admired their harvest. " You 've done frightfully well. " " We must have picked about thirty pounds. I 've never seen so many. We went over to the other side of the river where Mr. Gladstone grows his turnips. The hedgerows around those fields are groaning with fruit. " Isobel pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die for a cup of tea. " Archie said, " I have news for you. " She looked up quickly, always fearing the worst. " Good news? " " The best, " he told her. " But when did she call? What did she say? Why did n't she let us know before? " Isobel, alight with excitement, gave Archie no time to answer any question. " Why did n't they call us from Palma, or France, and give us more notice? Not that I need a moment 's notice, it does n't matter ; all that matters is that they 're coming, And staying at the Ritz. I do n't think p211 that Lucilla 's ever stayed in a hotel in the whole of her life. Pandora is ridiculous. They could easily have gone somewhere a little less grand....

" They were, by now, sitting around the table and drinking tea. Hamish, in famished desperation, had put the kettle on and made this. While his parents talked, he had set the table with three mugs, the tins that contained the cakes and biscuits, and a loaf of bread on its wooden board. As well, he had found butter and a jar of Branston Pickle. Hamish had, just now, a passion for Branston Pickle and spread it on everything. He was, at this moment, engaged in concocting a sandwich, the dark pickle oozing out between two enormous doorstops of bread. did she tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her? " " Not very much. Just sounded pleased with life. " " Oh, I wish I 'd been here to talk to her. " " You can talk to her tomorrow. " " Have you told anyone else they 're coming? " " No. Just you. " " I 'll have to call Verena and tell her she 's got three more people coming to her party. And I must tell Virginia. And Vi. " Archie reached for the teapot and refilled his mug. " I was thinking. Perhaps it would be a good idea to ask all the Airds for lunch on Sunday? What do you say? After all, we do n't know how long Pandora 's going to be staying, and next week 's going to be like a three-ring circus with one thing and another. Sunday might be a good day. " " That 's a brilliant idea. I 'll ring Virginia. And I 'll order a sirloin from the butcher. " Hamish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gingerbread. "... and if it 's a fine day we can play croquet. We have n't played croquet all summer. You 'll have to cut the grass, Archie. " She set down her mug, businesslike. " Now. I 've got to make bramble jelly, and I 'll 212 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p212 have to get all the bedrooms ready. But I must n't forget to ring Virginia.... " " I 'll do that, " said Archie. " You can leave that to me. " But Isobel, with the great jelly-pan set on the Aga and the blackberries simmering, knew that if she did not share her exciting news with somebody, she would burst, and so found time to call Violet. At first there was no reply from Pennyburn, so she hung up and called again half an hour later. " Hello. " " Vi, it 's Isobel. " " Oh, my dear. " " Are you busy? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hand. " " But, Vi, it 's only half past five. Have you taken to the bottle? " " Temporarily. I 've had the most exhausting day of my life, wheeling Lottie Carstairs around Relkirk and giving her tea. Never mind, it 's all over now and I 've done my good deed for the week. But I did feel I deserved a large whisky and soda. " " You certainly do. Or even two large whiskies and soda. Vi, something really exciting has happened. Lucilla rang from London and she 's coming home tomorrow and she 's bringing Pandora with her. " " She 's bringing who? " " Pandora. Archie 's over the moon with delight. Just think. He 's been trying to get her back to Croy for the past twenty-one years and now she 's actually coming. " " I ca n't believe it. " " Incredible, is n't it? Come for lunch on Sunday and see them all. We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can come with them. " " I 'd love to do that. But... Isobel, why did she suddenly decide to come? Pandora, I mean. " " No idea. Lucilla said something about the Steyntons ' party, but it seems a fairly feeble excuse. " " How extraordinary, I... I... wonder what she will look like? " " No idea. Probably smashing. Except that she 's thirty-nine now, so there are bound to be a few wrinkles. Anyway, we 'll soon see for our- p213 selves. I must go, Vi. I 'm making bramble jelly and it 's just about to boil over. See you Sunday. " " So kind. And I 'm thrilled about Lucilla... " But the brambles claimed Isobel. " ' Bye, Vi. " And she rang off. Pandora. Vi put down her receiver, took off her spectacles, and rubbed her aching eyes. She had been tired before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, left her with the sensation that she was being beleaguered. As though impossible demands were about to be made of her, and vital decisions to be made. She lay back in her chair and closed her eyes, wished that Edie were here, her oldest and dearest friend, so that she could confide, and discuss, and be comforted. But Edie was in her cottage, lumbered with Lottie, and even a telephone call was out of the question, with Lottie listening to every word and drawing her own dangerous conclusions. Pandora. Now thirty-nine, but because Violet had not seen her since she was eighteen, she had stayed, in Violet 's mind, perpetually that enchanting teenager. Like a person already dead. People who had died never aged, just stayed in the memory the way they had once been. Archie and Edmund had matured to middle age, but not Pandora. Which was ridiculous. Everybody grew older at the same speed, like people at airports being carried along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived a life, if all accounts were to be believed, that was anything but quiet and peaceful. Experience would have left its mark, drawing lines, wrinkling skin, dulling the bright lustre of that amazing hair. But it was almost impossible to imagine. Violet sighed, opened her eyes, reached for her drink. This would not do. She must pull herself together. The implications of the situation had nothing to do with her. She would make no decision because there was none to be made. She would simply continue to do what she had always done, which was to observe, disregard, and keep her counsel. Edmund Aird, returning home to Balnaid from Edinburgh at seven o'clock in the evening, walked through his front door just as the telephone started to ring. Standing in the hall, he paused, but when no one 214 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p214 immediately answered the call, he laid his brief-case down on the table and went to the library, to sit at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " " Edmund. Archie here. " " Yes, Archie. " " Isobel asked me to call you. She wants you and Virginia and Henry to come for lunch on Sunday. We 've asked Vi as well. Can you make it? " " How very kind of Isobel. I think so... just a moment... " He reached in his pocket for his diary, laid it on the blotter, turned the pages. " As far as I 'm concerned, that would be fine, but I 'm only just back and I have n't spoken to Virginia yet. Do you want me to go and find her? " " No, do n't bother. You can ring me if you ca n't come, and if we do n't hear, we 'll expect you all at about a quarter to one. " " We look forward to it. " Edmund hesitated. " Is this for some occasion we should know about, or just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And then said, " Yes. I mean, it is an occasion. Lucilla 's coming home tomorrow.... " " That 's great news. " " She 's bringing some Australian with her. " " The sheep-farmer? " " That 's right. And she 's bringing Pandora. " Edmund, with some deliberation, closed his diary. It was bound in navy-blue hide, with his initials in gold in one corner, It had been in his stocking last Christmas, a present from Virginia. " Pandora? " " Yes. Lucilla and the sheep-farmer went to stay with her in Majorca. They 've all come back together, driving through Spain and France. Got to London this morning. " Archie paused, as though waiting for some comment from Edmund. But Edmund did not speak and, after a bit, Archie went on. " I forwarded an invitation from Verena Steynton, so I suppose she thought it might be fun to come home for the party. " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes. " Another pause. " Sunday then, Edmund? " " Yes, of course. " " Unless we hear from you. " " We look forward to it. Thank you for calling. " He rang off. The library, the house were silent. It occurred to him that perhaps Virginia an Henry were out somewhere, and he was totally alone. This sense of olitude grew, became oppressive. He found himself straining his ears, needing the reassurance of a raised voice, the clatter of dishes, the bark of a dog. Nothing. Then, from beyond the open window, p215 came the long, bubbling call of a curlew, flying low over the fields beyond the garden. A cloud covered the sun, and the cool air stirred. He put the diary back in his pocket, smoothed his hair with his hand, straightened his tie. He needed a drink. He got up from the chair, left the room, and went in search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tenth LUCILLA SAID, " I 'VE NEVER COME home in such style before. " " How did you come before? " Jeff was driving. He had been at the wheel the whole of their long journey north. " In trains from school. Or driving a ratty little car from Edinburgh. Once I flew from London, but that was in the days when Dad was still a soldier and the War Office paid my fare. " It was half past three, a Saturday afternoon, and now there were only twenty miles to go. They had made good time. The motorway was behind them, Relkirk bypassed, and the winding road comfortingly familiar, leading them to Strathcroy and home. The river kept them company, and ahead lay the hills. The air was clear, the sky enormous, and the fresh breeze, sweeping in through opened windows, sweet and heady as young wine. Lucilla could scarcely believe their good fortune. It had been raining in London and pouring in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had watched the clouds disintegrate, disperse, roll away to the east, and Scotland welcomed them with a blue sky and trees just on the point of turning gold. Lucilla thought that this was extremely obliging of her native country and felt as pleased as if she, personally, had stage-managed the miraculous transformation, but deliberately made no comment on either their luck or the stunning scenery. She had known Jeff for long enough to discover that he did not appreciate, and was even embarrassed by, over-effusion. They had set off at ten o'clock this morning, checking out of the Ritz, and watching the majestic porters load Pandora 's dark-red Mercedes with her impressive array of matched luggage, along with their own humble backpacks. Pandora had forgotten to tip the porters, so Lucilla p217 had had to do it for her. She knew that she would never get it back, but after a night of total luxury with dinner and breakfast thrown in, she felt that it was the least she could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of her magnificent car, cosy in her mink, because after the nailing heat of a Majorcan August, she felt in need of its opulent comfort. The cold and the rain were not what she had expected. While Jeff drove them out of the city, jousted with traffic, achieved the motorway, she kept up an endless stream of inconsequential chat. Later, she fell silent, gazing out of the window at the grey and dull countryside through which they swept, in the fast lane, at eighty miles an hour. The windscreen wipers worked flat out, immense juggernauts sent up blinding, muddy showers of spray, and even Lucilla had to admit that it was all thoroughly disagreeable. " Goodness, it 's ugly. " Pandora snuggled deeper into her fur. " I know. But it 's just this bit. " For lunch, they stopped at a Motorway Service Station. Pandora wanted to leave the motorway and go in search of some wayside pub, preferably thatched, where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concoctions like whisky and ginger ale. But Lucilla knew that if they allowed themselves to be so diverted, they would never get back to Croy. " There is n't time. This is n't Spain, Pandora. It is n't France. We 've no time to waste on frivolities. " " Darling, hardly a frivolity. " " Yes, it is. And you 'd get talking to the barman and we 'd be there forever. " So the Motorway Service Station it was, which proved just as unenjoyable as Lucilla feared it would be. Queuing with trays for sandwiches and coffee ; and then sitting on orange plastic chairs at a Formica table, hemmed in by irritable families with fractious children, punky youths in pornographic T-shirts, and muscular truck drivers, all seemingly content to wrap themselves around mind-boggling platefuls of fish and chips, evilly coloured trifles, and cups of tea. After lunch, Pandora and Lucilla had changed places ; Pandora had made herself comfortable on the back seat and fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which meant that she had missed the dramatic crossing of the Border, the clearing of the sky, and the miraculous cxcitement of actually coming home. They drove through a small country town. " Where 's this? " Jeff asked. " Kirkthornton. " The pavements were crammed with Saturday-afternoon shoppers, the municipal gardens bright with dahlias. Old men sat on benches enjoying 218 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p218 the kindly warmth. Children licked ice-creams. A bridge curved high over a tumbling river. A man fished. The road led on up the hill. Pandora, bundled in mink, was curled up like a child, her head supported by Jeff 's jacket rolled into a pillow. A lock of bright hair fell across her face, her lashes lay black on her jutting cheek-bones. " Do you think I should wake her up? " " Up to you. " This had been her pattern, her routine, all through the long journey from Palma, through Spain and France. Spurts of immense energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impetuous suggestions. We really should see that cathedral. It 's only ten kilometers out of our way. Look at that delicious river. Why do n't we stop for a moment and have a skinny-dip? There 's no one to see. You know, we 've just passed the most enchanting cafe. Let 's turn round and go back and have a drink. But the drink would spin out into a long and leisurely lunch, with Pandora falling into conversation with any person who happened to be within earshot. Another bottle of wine. Coffee and cognac. And then... out. Sleep. She could catnap anywhere, and though this was sometimes embarrassing, it meant, at least, that she stopped talking, and Lucilla and Jeff had learned to be grateful for these respites. Without them Lucilla was not certain whether they would have survived the passage. Travelling with Pandora was a little like travelling with an ebullient child, or a dog -- entertaining and companionable but as well quite dauntingly draining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the countryside opened and the views were magnificent. Beeches, fields, scattered farms, grazing sheep, the river far below them, the far-away hills bloomy and purple as ripe plums. " If I do n't wake her now she 'll still be asleep when we get home. It 's only about ten minutes away. " " Then wake her. " Lucilla stretched out her arm, laid her hand on the soft fur of Pando-ra 's shoulder and gave her a little shake. " Pandora. " " Um. " " Pandora. " Another shake. " Wake up. We 're almost there. We 're almost home. " " What? " Pandora 's eyes fluttered open. They stared blankly, disonen- p219 tated, confused. She closed them again, yawned, stirred, stretched. " What a lovely sleep. Where are we? " " Heading for Caple Bridge. Almost home. " " Almost home? Almost at Croy? " " Sit up and you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive, snoring away on the back seat. " " I was n't snoring. I never snore. " But after a bit she made an effort and did sit up, pushing her hair out of her eyes, gathering her furs around her as though chilled. She yawned again, stared from the window. Blinked. Her eyes brightened. " But... we 're nearly there! " " I told you. " " You should have woken me hours ago. And the rain 's gone. It 's all sunshiny. And the green. I 'd forgotten such greenness. What a welcome. Caledonia, stern and wild, fit nurse for a poetic child. ' Who wrote that? Some stupid old fool. It 's not stern and wild, it 's just utterly beautiful. How perfectly sweet of it to be looking so lovely. " She groped for her bag, her comb ; tidied her hair. A mirror, some lipstick. A generous splash of Poison. " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget about his leg. Do n't expect him to come running to sweep you up in his arms. If he sweeps you up in his arms, he 'll probably fall flat on his back. " " As if I 'd suggest such a thing. " She looked at her tiny diamond watch. " We 're early. We said we 'd be there at five and it 's not four o'clock yet. " " We 've made fantastic time. " " Dear Jeff. " Pandora gave his shoulder an appreciative thump, as though she were patting a dog ; " What a clever driver. " Now they were running downhill. At the bottom of the incline, they took the steep hump of Caple Bridge, turned left, and were at the start of the glen. Pandora leaned forward in her seat. " But it 's amazing. Absolutely nothing seems to have changed. Some people called Miller used to live in that cottage. They were terribly old. He 'd been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to keep bees and sell jars of heather honey. Oh dear, I 'm getting so fraught, I think I might have to stop for a pee. No, of course I do n't want to. Just imagination. " She gave Jeff another thump on his shoulder. " Jeff, you 're doing your silent act again. Ca n't you think up one small word of appreciation? " " Sure, " he grinned. " It 's great. " " It 's more than that. It 's our country now. The Balmerinos of Croy. Really heart-stirring, like a roll of drums. And we 're coming home. We should be wearing feathers in our bonnets, and there should be a piper 220 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p220 playing somewhere. Why did n't you think of that, Lucilla? Why did n't you arrange it? After twenty years, surely it 's the least you could have done for me. " Lucilla laughed. " I 'm sorry. " Now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verdant with green rushes, the pastures on the other side grazed by peaceful herds of Friesian cows. Harvested fields were carpets of gold in the sunlight. The Mercedes swept around the curve of the road and the village of Strathcroy came into view. Lucilla saw the cluster of grey stone houses, smoke rising straight from chimney-pots, the tower of the church, the pleasing groups of ancient and shady beeches and oaks. Jeff slowed down to a prudent speed and they passed the War Memorial, the small Episcopal church, and were into the long, straight main street. " The supermarket 's new. " Pandora sounded quite accusing. " I know. It 's run by people called Ishak. They 're Pakistanis. Now, Jeff, it 's here... turn right.. up through the gates.... " " But the park 's gone! It 's not parkland any more. It 's all ploughed up. " Pandora, you knew that happened. Dad wrote and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it does look strange. " Up the back drive. The hill reared ahead of them, the tumbling waters of the Pennyburn splashed and tumbled down under the little stone bridge. Then the avenue... " We 're here, " said Lucilla, and leaned across Jeff to put the heel of her hand on the horn. At Croy, Lucilla 's family filled in the long waiting hours of the afternoon. Isobel was upstairs seeing to the final details of the visitors ' bedrooms, checking clean towels and arranging flowers for dressing-tables and mantelpieces. Hamish had decided to take the dogs for a walk, disappeared after lunch and had not been seen since. And Archie, Lord Balmerino, was in the dining-room laying the table for dinner. He had been finally forced into doing this. Waiting for anything or anybody was not his strong point, and as the day wore on, he had become increasingly restless, impatient, and anxious. He hated the thought of his loved ones belting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no difficulty at all in presenting hideously detailed pic- p221 tures of pile-ups, mangled metal, and dead bodies. He had spent much time looking at his watch, going to the window at the faintest sound of a car engine, and was patently unable to settle for a moment. Isobel had suggested that he mow the croquet lawn but he had turned this down because he wanted to be certain of being on the spot when the car actually drew up in front of the house. Retreating to his study, he had sat down with The Scotsman but could not concentrate either on the news or the crossword. He tossed the paper aside and started prowling again. At last Isobel, who had enough to do without her husband getting under her feet, lost her patience. " Archie, if you ca n't sit still, then make yourself useful. You can lay the table for dinner. The clean mats and the napkins are on the side-board. " And she had gone upstairs quite crossly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minded laying tables. In the old days, Harris used to perform the task, so there could be nothing unmanly about it. And when the American paying guests stayed, laying the table for dinner was always Archie 's job, and he got certain pleasure from doing it with military thoroughness, knives and forks precisely aligned, and napkins folded into mitres. The wineglasses looked slightly dusty, so he had found a tea-towel and was engaged in giving them a bit of a polish when he heard the car coming up the hill. His heart lurched. He looked at the clock, which told him four o'clock. Too early surely. He set down the glass and the cloth. It could not be.... The blast of the car horn, a long continuous blare, tore the quiet afternoon and his own uncertainty into shreds. Lucilla 's traditional signal. He could not move fast, but he moved as fast as he could. Down the length of the dining-room, through the door. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was crossing the hall as the car appeared, a thundering great Mercedes scattering gravel beneath its wheels. " Isobel! They 're here. " He got to the door but no farther. Pandora was quicker than he, out of the car almost before it had drawn to a halt, running across the gravel towards him. Pandora with that same bright hair flying all over the place and those same long spindly legs. " Archie! " She wore a fur coat that reached almost to her ankles but that did not stop her bounding two at a time up the steps, and if he could no longer Ift her off her feet and whirl her around the way he used to when she was i p222 a child, there was nothing the matter with his arms, and his arms were ready and waiting for her. Isobel... dear, uncomplicated, hospitable, unchanging Isobel.. had allocated Pandora the best spare bedroom. This was in the front of the house, with tall sash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the river. It was furnished much as Pandora remembered it in her mother 's day. Twin brass bedsteads, high off the ground, each wide as a small double bed. A faded carpet patterned with roses and an ornate dressing-table with many small drawers and a swing-mirror. The old curtains, however, were gone, and heavy cream linen draperies hung in their place. The refurbishment had probably been planned with all the paying guests in mind. They would scarcely appreciate threadbare chintz with sun-rotted linings. For them as well, the adjoining dressingroom had been converted into a bathroom. Not that it looked very different, because Isobel had simply installed a bath and a basin and a lavatory, and left the rugs, the laden bookshelves, and the comfortable armchair where they were. Pandora was meant to be unpacking. " Unpack and make yourself comfortable, " Isobel had told her. She and Jeff, between them, had humped all Pandora 's luggage upstairs.( Archie, of course, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pandora decided not to think about Archie. His grey hairs had shocked her, and she had never seen a man so thin.) " Have a bath if you want. There 's gallons of hot water. Then come down and have a drink. We 'll eat about eight o'clock. " But that was fifteen minutes ago and Pandora had got no farther than carrying her dressing-case into the bathroom and putting a few bottles out on the marble wash-stand. Her pills and potions, her Poison, bath-oil, creams and cleansers. Later she would have a bath. Not now. Now, she still had to convince herself that she was really home. Back at Croy. But it was difficult because in this room she did not feel as though she belonged. She was a guest come to stay, a bird of passage. Abandoning her bottles, she went back to the bedroom, to the window, to lean out with her elbows on the sill, to gaze at the oft-remembered view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all a dream. This took some time. But what had happened to her own room, the room that had been Pandora 's since babyhood? She decided to go and have a nose-around. p223 She went out of the room, went to the top of the stairs, paused. From the direction of the kitchen came cheerful domestic sounds and muted voices. Lucilla and Isobel busy with preparations for dinner and probably talking about Pandora. They were bound to talk. It did not matter ; she did not mind. She crossed the landing and opened the door of what had been her parents ' room, and was now Archie and Isobel 's. She saw the huge double bed, the chaise longue at the foot of it with a sweater of Isobel 's flung down, a pair of shoes, carelessly discarded. She saw the family photographs, the silver and crystal on the dressing-table, bedside books. There was the smell of face-powder and eau-de-cologne. Sweet and innocent scents. She closed the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room that had been Archie 's, swept and garnished with Jeff 's backpack and his jacket set down in the middle of the carpet. The next room... Lucilla. Still filled with all the cherished flotsam of a schoolgirl... posters thumbtacked to the walls, china ornaments, a tape player, a guitar with a broken string. And finally her own room. Her old room. Perhaps Hamish slept here? She had not yet met Hamish. Cautiously she turned the knob and pushed the door open. Not Hamish. Not anybody. Empty of any personal possession. New furniture, new curtains. No trace of Pandora. What had they done with her books, her records, clothes, diaries, photographs... her life? All probably swept upstairs to some attic when the room was stripped and emptied, repainted, re-wallpapered, and given that beautiful new, blue, fitted carpet. It was as though Pandora had ceased to exist, was already a ghost. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was patently obvious. Croy belonged to Archie and Isobel, and to keep the place going as a viable proposition, every room must be put to good use. And Pandora had given up any claim to it by the simple act of going away and never coming back. Standing there, she thought of those last miserable weeks when she had been beyond herself with an unhappiness that she was not allowed to talk about. Misery had made her cruel, and she was cruel to the two people she loved most in the world ; snapping at her father, ignoring her mother, sulking for days on end and generally making their lives a mis-cry. In this room, she had spent hours lying face downwards on her bed with her record player churning out, over and over again, the saddest gongs she knew. Matt Monro telling some female to " Walk Away. " And udy Garland tearing her guts out with " The Man That Got Away. " 224 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p224 The road gets tougher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burn up, Tomorrow he will turn up.. Voices. Darling, do come and eat some lunch. I do n't want any lunch. I wish you 'd tell me what 's troubling you. I just want to be left alone. It would n't be any good telling you. You 'd never understand.... She saw again her mother 's face, confused and dreadfully hurt. And was ashamed. At eighteen, I should have known better. I thought that I was adult and sophisticated, but the truth was that I knew less about life than a child. And it took me too long to find out. Too long, and too late. All over, She closed the door and went back to her unpacking. Dinner was over. They had sat, the six of them, around the candle-lit table, and eaten their way through Isobel 's lovingly prepared celebratory meal. If she had not exactly killed a fatted calf, she had gone to great pains to produce a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brulee, and a splendid Stilton, all washed down by the best wine that Archie could bring up from his father 's depleted cellar. Now it was nearly ten o'clock, and Isobel, with Pandora in attendance, was in the kitchen dealing with the last of the washing-up -- the pots and pans, the ivory-handled knives and vegetable dishes too large to fit into the dishwasher. Pandora was meant to be helping, but after drying up a knife or two and putting three saucepans into the wrong cupboard, she had laid aside the tea-towel, made herself a mug of Nescafe, and sat down to drink it. Conversation during dinner had been non-stop, for there was much to hear and much to tell. The adventure of Lucilla and Jeff 's bus journey down through France from Paris ; their Bohemian sojourn in Ibiza ; and at last the bliss of Majorca and the Casa Rosa. Isobel 's mouth had watered, hearing Lucilla 's description of the garden there. p225 " Oh, I would love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lie in the sun and do nothing. " Archie laughed at this. " Isobel lie in the sun and do nothing? You must be mad. Before you could blink, she 'd be bottoms up in the flower-beds, tearing at weeds. " " I have n't got any weeds, " said Pandora.. And then, home news. Pandora was avid for every scrap of gossip. The latest on Vi, the Airds, the Gillocks, Willy Snoddy. Did Archie still hear from Harris and Mrs. Harris? She listened with some dismay to the saga of Edie Findhorn and her cousin Lottie. " Heavens! That ghoul. Do n't say she 's come back into our lives. I 'm glad you warned me. I shall take pains to cross the road if I see her coming. " She was told about the Ishak family, exiled from Malawi and arriving in Strathcroy with scarcely a penny between them. "... but they had some relations in Glasgow who 'd already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of financial help from them, they managed to take over Mrs. McTaggart 's newsagent 's shop. You would n't recognize the place. It 's a proper supermarket. We did n't think they 'd last, but we were all mistaken. They 're as industrious as ants, never seem to close their shop, and business booms. As well, we like them. They 're all so helpful and kind. " And so on to the Balmerinos ' slightly grander neighbours, which meant anybody living within a radius of twenty miles : the BuchananWrights, the Ferguson-Crombies, the new people who had come to live at Ardnamoy ; whose daughter had married ; whose unlikely son had become a money-broker in the City and was coining millions. No detail was unimportant. The only topic that was never brought up, as though by tacit agreement, was Pandora and what she had been doing with herself for the past twenty-one years. She did not mind. She was back at Croy and for the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into unreality, like a life that had happened to another person, and surrounded by family she was happy to consign them to oblivion. Sitting at the kitchen table, she sipped coffee and watched Isobel at the sink, scouring the roasting pan. Isobel wore red rubber gloves and a blue-226 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p226 and-white apron tied over her tidy dress, and it occurred to Pandora that she was an exceptional woman, peacefully labouring away and quite unresentful of the fact that the rest of her family had taken themselves off, and she was left to clear up the detritus of the meal by herself. For, after dinner, the others had all dispersed. Archie, excusing himself, had gone down to his workshop. Hamish, with the promise of financial reward, had agreed to take advantage of the long evening light and mow the croquet lawn. He had gone to do this with good grace, and Pandora was much impressed. What she did not realize was how impressed Hamish had been by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Hamish had visions of a Vi-type person with grey hair and laced-up shoes, and had received the shock of his life when he was introduced to Pandora. A stunner. Like a film star. Over his pheasant, he entertained fantasies of showing her off to the other seniors in his class at Templehall. Perhaps Dad would bring her over to watch some match or other. Hamish 's stock with schoolmates would go sky-high. He wondered if she liked rugger. " Isobel, I do love Hamish. " " I 'm quite keen on him myself. I just hope he does n't grow too enor-mous. " " He 's going to be divinely handsome. " She took another mouthful of coffee. " Do you like Jeff? " Jeff, predictably sated by two weeks of female company and unaccustomed gracious living, had wheeled Lucilla down to the Strathcroy Arms for a restoring jar of Foster 's lager downed in comfortably masculine surroundings. " He seems really nice. " " Terribly kind. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his patience. A bit laconic, though. I suppose all Australians are strong and silent. I would n't really know. Never met any others. " " Do you think Lucilla 's in love with him? " " No, I do n't think so. They 're just... that awful phrase... very good friends. Besides, she 's terribly young. You do n't want to start thinking about permanent relationships when you 're only nineteen. " " You mean marriage. " " No, darling. I do n't mean marriage. " Isobel fell silent. Pandora decided that she had, perhaps, said the wrong thing and cast about for a more amusing and less touchy topic. " Isobel, I know who you have n't told me about. Dermot Honeycombe and Terence. Are they still running the antique shop? " p227 " Oh dear. " Isobel turned from the sink. " Did n't Archie tell you in one of his letters? So sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't believe it. What did poor Dermot do? Find himself another nice young man? " " No, never. He was heart-broken, but faithful. We all thought he might leave Strathcroy, but he stayed ; all by himself. Still running the antique shop, still living in their little cottage. Every now and then he asks Archie and me over for a meal, and gives us tiny helpings of frightfully dainty food with amusing sauces. Archie always comes home starving and has to be given soup or cornflakes before he goes to bed. " " Poor Dermot. I must go and see him. " " He 'd love that. He 's always asking after you. " " I can buy some trinket from him to give Katy Steynton for her birthday. We have n't talked about that either. The dance, I mean. " Isobel, finished at last, pulled off her rubber gloves, laid them on the drainingboard, and came to sit down with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge house party? " " No. Just us. No Hamish because he 'll be back at school. And some sad American Katy met in London and took pity on. Verena has n't got space for him, so he 's coming here. " " Goodness! How nice. A man for me. Why is he sad? " " His wife 's just died. " " Oh dear, I hope he 's not too gloomy. Where 's he going to sleep? " " In your old bedroom. " Which settled that question. " And what about the night of the party? Where are we having dinner? " " Here, I think. We could ask the Airds to join us, and Vi. They 're coming for lunch tomorrow ; I thought I 'd speak to Virginia then. " " You never said. " " What, that they 're coming for lunch? Well, I 've told you now. That 's why Hamish is cutting the croquet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on. What are you going to wear for the dance? Have you got a new dress? " " No. I 've run out of money. I had to buy Hamish five new pairs of shoes for school.... " " But, Isobel, you must have a new dress. We 'll go and find one for you. Where shall we go? To Relkirk. We 'll have a day out... " " Pandora, I told you... I really ca n't afford it. " " Oh, darling, the least I can do is stand you a little gift. " The back door opened and Hamish appeared, having finished his mowing just be-228 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p228 fore darkness fell, and once again in his usual state of ravenous hunger. " We 'll talk about it later. " Hamish collected his snack. A bowl of Weetabix, a glass of milk, a handful of chocolate biscuits. Pandora finished her coffee, set down the mug. She yawned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm bushed. " She got to her feet. " Good night, Hamish. " She did not attempt to kiss him and Hamish was torn between relief and disappointment. " Will I find Archie in his workshop? I 'll just pop down and have a word. " She stooped and kissed Isobel. " And good night to you, darling. Heaven to be here. Delicious dinner. See you all in the morning. " In the basement, Archie, absorbed and concentrated, worked by a strong bulb with a wide shade that threw a bright circle onto his workbench. Painting the carving of Katy and her dog was both tricky and fiddly. The muted check of the skirt, the texture of the sweater, the subtle, varying streaks of colour in the hair, each presented a challenge and took all his dexterity to accomplish. He laid down one sable brush and took up another, then heard Pandora approach. Her step was unmistakable, descending the stone stair that led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her high heels down the ill-lighted stone-flagged passage. He paused in his work to look up and saw the door open and Pandora 's head come around the edge of it. " Am I interrupting? " " No. " " Goodness, it 's gloomy. I could n't find the light switch. Like a dungeon. But I must say, you 're quite cosy in here. " She found a chair and sat beside him. " What are you doing? " " Painting. " " I can see that. What a charming little statue. Where did you get it? " He told her, not without pride. " I made it. " " You made it? Archie, you are brilliant. I never knew you were so handy. " " It 's for Katy 's birthday. It 's her. With her dog. " " What a lovely idea. You did n't used to be able to make things. It was p29 always Pa who glued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to classes or something? " " I suppose I did. After I was wounded... " He corrected himself. " After my leg was shot off and when I was finally discharged from hospital, I got sent to Headley Court. That 's the Forces rehabilitation centre for chaps who 've been disabled. Dismembered in some way. That 's where they fit the artificial limbs. Legs, arms, hands, feet. Anything that you are missing is supplied for you. Within, of course, reason. And then they give you months of bloody hell until you 've learned to use it properly. " " It does n't sound very nice. " " It was all right. And there was always some poor bugger worse off than yourself. " " But you were alive. You were n't dead. " " True. " " Is it very horrible, having a tin leg? " " Better than none at all, which seems to be the alternative. " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " " Was it a nightmare? " " All violence is a nightmare. " Forbidden ground. She backed off. " I 'm sorry... go on telling me. " " Well... once I... " He had lost the thread of what he had been saying. He took off his spectacles, rubbed his eyes with his fingers. " Once... I was more or less ambulant, they taught me how to use a treadle jigsaw. Occupational therapy and good exercise for the leg. And from that, it sort of snowballed... " It was all right. The dangerous moment was safely over. If Archie did not want to talk about Northern Ireland, then Pandora did not want to hear. " Do you mend things, like Pa used to? " " Yes. " " And that dear little figure. How do you start to make something like that? Where do you begin? " " You start with a block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " For this one, I used beech. Beech from Croy, a windblown branch from years back. I squared it off into a block with the chainsaw. Then I made two drawings from the photograph, a front view and a side view. Then I transferred the front elevation onto the face of the block, and the side elevation onto the side of the block. Are you with me? " " All the way. " 230 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p230 " Then I cut it out on the band-saw. " " What 's a band-saw? " He pointed. " That 's the band-saw. It 's electrically operated and lethally sharp, so do n't start fiddling. " " I was n't going to. What do you do then? " " Start carving. Whittling. " " What with? " " Wood-carver 's chisels. A penknife. " " I 'm amazed. Is this the first you 've done? " " By no means, but this was more difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog. That was quite difficult. Before, they 've been standing figures. Soldiers mostly, in various regimental uniforms. I get the details of the uniforms from a book of plates I found up in Pa 's library. It was that book that gave me the idea. They make quite good wedding presents if the bridegroom happens to be in the Army. " " Have you got any to show me? " " Yes. There 's one here. " He pulled himself out of his chair, went to a cupboard, took out a box. " I did n't actually give this one away because I was n't quite satisfied with it, so I made another. But it 'll give you an idea.... " Pandora took the figure of the soldier from him and turned it in her hands. It was a replica of an officer in the Black Watch, every detail perfect -- from brogues, to kilt, to the red hackle in his khaki bonnet. She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archie 's unsuspected talent, his precision, his undeniable artistry. Also incredulous. " Do you mean to say you give these away? Archie, you 're dotty. They 're beautiful. Unique. Visitors from overseas would snap up just such a souvenir. Have you ever tried selling them? " " No. " He seemed quite surprised at the idea. " Have you ever thought of it? " " No. " She knew a burst of sisterly irritation. " You are hopeless. You always were a laid-back old stick, but this is ridiculous. There 's Isobel slaving away, trying to keep everything going by having strings of Americans to stay, and you could be churning these things out and making a fortune. " " I doubt that. Anyway, it 's not a case of churning. They take a lot of time. " " Well, get someone to help you. Get two people to help you. Start a little home industry. " " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stables? They 're empty. Or one of the barns? " p231 " It would mean reconstruction, equipping, electricity laid on, safety regulations, fire precautions. " " So? " " So it would cost money. Which is a commodity pretty thin on the ground. " " Could you get a grant? " " Grants, as well, are thin on the ground just now. " " You could try for one. Oh, do n't be so hopeless, Archie. Be a bit more enterprising. I think it 's the most wonderful idea. " " Pandora, you were always full of wonderful ideas. " He took the soldier from her and laid him back in his box. " But you 're right about Isobel. I do what I can to help, but I know she 's got far too much on her plate. Before Northern Ireland, I thought about trying to get some sort of a job... as a factor, or something. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't want to leave Croy, and it seemed the only sort of work I could do.... " His voice, ruminating, trailed to silence. " But now you 've learned a new trade. All this. Hidden talents have sprung to life. All you need is a little enterprise and a lot of determina-tion. " " And a lot of money. " " Archie "? she spoke quite crossly? " whether you have one leg or two, you ca n't just shed responsibility. " " Are you speaking from experience? " " Touche " Pandora laughed and shook her head. " No. I 'm the last to preach. Just talking off the top of my head. " Abruptly, she abandoned the argument, yawned and stretched, reached upwards, spreading her fingers. " I 'm tired. I came to say good night. I 'm going to bed. " " I hope you have sweet dreams. " " What about you? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with. Then, every spare moment I have I shall be able to spend with you. " " Dear man. " On her feet, she stooped to kiss him. " I 'm glad I came home. " " Me too. " She went to the door, opened it, hesitated, and turned back. " Archie? " " What is it? " " I 've often wondered. Did you get that letter I sent you in Berlin? " " Yes. " " You never replied. " 232 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p232 " By the time I 'd decided what I was going to say, you 'd gone to America and it was too late. " " Did you tell Isobel? " " No. " " Did you. speak to anybody? " " No. " " I see. " She smiled. " The Airds are coming for lunch tomorrow. " " I know. I asked them. " " Good night, Archie. " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The house settled as the momentum of another busy day wound itself down. Hamish watched television for a bit and then made his way upstairs. Isobel, in the kitchen, laid the table for breakfast -- the last chore of the day -- and then let the dogs out for their last sniff around the dark garden, alert for scents of marauding rabbit. Lights were turned off, and she too headed for bed. Later still Jeff and Lucilla returned from the village. They let themselves in through the back door. Archie heard their voices above him in the hall. And then silence. Past midnight, and he was finally finished. Another day and the enamel would be dry. He tidied up, put lids on small paint-pots, cleaned his brushes, turned off the light and closed the door. Slowly he made his way down the shadowy passage and up the stairs to do his nightly rounds, which he called putting the house to bed. He checked locks on doors and snibs on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, he found the dogs asleep. He filled a tumbler with water and drank it. Finally he trod up the stairs. But he did not go immediately to his own bedroom. Instead he walked down the passage and saw the shaft of light, still burning, beneath the door of Lucilla 's room. He tapped and opened the door and found her in bed, reading by lamplight. " Lucilla. " She looked up, marked her page and laid her book aside. " I thought you 'd gone to bed hours ago. " " No. I 've been working. " He came to sit on the edge of her bed. " Did you have a good evening? " " Yes, it was fun. Toddy Buchanan in his usual good form. " " I wanted to say good night, and I wanted to say thank you. " " What for? " " Coming home. Bringing Pandora. " His hand lay on her eiderdown. She laid her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white lawn trimmed with lace, but Lucilla slept in a green T-shirt with " Save the Rain Forests " printed across the chest. Her long dark hair was spread like silk on her pillow, and he was filled with love for her. " You 're not disappointed? " she asked him. " Why should I be disappointed? " " Often when you 've looked forward to something for years, you feel a bit let down when it actually happens. " " I do n't feel let down. " " She is beautiful. " " But dreadfully thin, do n't you think? " " I know. There 's nothing of her. But she 's so hyper that she burns everything up. " " What do you mean? " " Just that. She sleeps a lot, but when she 's awake she 's charging on every cylinder. Super-charging, I would say. Being with her all the time is really quite exhausting. And then she passes out as though sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her batteries. " " She was always like that. Mrs. Harris used to say, That Pandora. Either up in the clouds or doon in the midden. ' " " Manic-depressive. " " Surely not as bad as that. " " Tending that way. " He frowned. And then asked the question that had been niggling around at the back of his mind all evening. " You do n't think she 's on drugs? " " Oh, Dad. " He immediately wished that he had not mentioned his fears. " I only ask you because I imagine you know more about these things than I do. " " She 's certainly not a junkie. But perhaps she does take something to bubble her along. A lot of people do. " " But she 's not addicted? " " Oh, Dad, I do n't know. But worrying about Pandora is n't going to do any good. You 've just got to accept her for what she is. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Lots of laughs. " " In Majorca... do you think she 's happy? " " She seems to be. And why not? A heavenly house, a garden, a pool, lots of money... " " Does she have friends? " " She has Seraphina and Mario, who take care of her... " " That was n't what I meant. " 234 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p234 " I know. No, we did n't meet her friends, so I do n't know if she has any or not. We did n't really meet anybody. Except one man. He was there the day we arrived, but after that we never saw him again. " " I thought she would have a resident lover. " " I think probably he was her lover and the reason he did n't come back was because we were there. " He said nothing to this, and Lucilla smiled. " It 's a different world out there, Dad. " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arms around his neck and pulled him down and kissed him. She said, " You must n't worry. " " I wo n't. " " Good night, Dad. " " Good night, my darling. God bless you. " p235 Sunday the Eleventh SUNDAY MORNING. OVERCAST, VERY STILL, very quiet, hushed with the weekly inertia of a Scottish Sabbath. It had rained during the night, leaving puddles by the roadside and gardens dripping with moisture. In Strathcroy, cottages slumbered, curtains stayed drawn. Slowly the occupants stirred, rose, opened doors, lit fires, made cups of tea. Plumes of peat-smoke rose, straight, from chimney-pots. Dogs were walked, hedges clipped, cars washed. Mr. Ishak opened up his shop for the sale of morning rolls, milk, cigarettes, Sunday newspapers, and any other commodity that a family might need to get through the empty day. From the tower of the Presbyterian church, the bell tolled. At Croy, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them, cooked their own breakfast. Bacon and eggs, sausages and tomatoes, racks of fresh toast, marmalade and honey, all washed down with large cups of very strong tea. Isobel, descending later, found their dirty breakfast dishes stacked by the sink, and a note from Hamish, Dear Mum. Jeff and me have taken the dogs up to the loch. He wants to see it. Back about twelve-thirty. In time for beef. Isobel made coffee, sat and drank it, thought about peeling potatoes, making a pudding. She wondered if there was enough cream for a fool. Lucilla appeared, and finally Archie, wearing his good tweed suit because it was his day to read the lesson in church. Neither his wife nor his daughter offered to accompany him. With ten people for lunch, they had more than enough to do. Pandora slept the morning through and did not put in an appearance 236 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p236 until a quarter past twelve, by which time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. It was instantly clear, however, that she had not been idle, but busy titivating : painting her nails, washing her hair, doing her face, splashing herself in Poison. She wore a jersey dress patterned in diamonds of brilliant colour ; it was so fine and supple and elegant that it had to be Italian. Discovering Lucilla in the library, she swore that she had slept the night through, but seemed perfectly happy to sink into the depths of an armchair and gratefully accept the offer of a glass of sherry. At Pennyburn, Vi sat up in her bed, drank her early morning tea, and planned her day. She should perhaps go to church. There was plenty to pray for. She thought about this and then decided against it. Instead, selfindulgence. She would stay where she was, conserving her energy. She 'd finish her current book and then, after a late breakfast, sit at her desk to deal with overdue bills, pension funds, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, she had been invited to Croy. Edmund, with Virginia and Henry, would pick her up and drive her on up the hill. She thought about this with more disquiet than delight and gazed from the window and assessed the mood of the weather : rain all night but now damp and still and muggy. Perhaps later it would cheer up. It was the sort of day, in more ways than one, that needed to be cheered up. For comfort, she decided, she would wear her grey wool. For courage, the new Hermes scarf. At Balnaid, Virginia went in search of Henry. " Henry, come and change. " He was on the floor of his playroom, constructing Space Lego, and resented the interruption. " Why do I have to change? " " Because we 're going out for lunch and you ca n't go looking like that. " " Why ca n't I? " p237 " Because your jeans are dirty, and your T-shirt 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are dirty. " " Do I have to dress up? " " No, but you have to put on a clean T-shirt and a clean pair of jeans and a clean pair of sneakers. " " What about socks? " " Clean socks. " He sighed, hard done by. " Do I have to put my Space Lego away? " " No, of course you do n't have to. Leave it where it is. Just come, or Daddy 'll start getting impatient. " She led him, lagging, to his bedroom, then sat on his bed and stripped off his T-shirt. " Will there be any other children there? " " Hamish. " " He wo n't want to play with me. " " Henry, you 're such a ninny about Hamish. If you do n't behave like a ninny, he 'll like playing with you. Take off your jeans and your trainers. " " Who 's going to be there? " " Us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she 's come home from France. And her friend. He 's called Jeff. And Pandora " " Who 's Pandora? " " Archie 's sister. " " Do I know her? " " No. " " Do you know her? " " No. " " Does Daddy know her? " " Yes. He knew her when she was a little girl. Vi knows her too. " " Why do n't you know her? " " Because she 's been living abroad for a long, long time. She lived in America. This is the first time she 's come back to Croy. " " Does Alexa know her? " " No. Alexa was only a tiny baby when she went to America. " " Does Pandora know your gramps and grandma at Leesport? " " No. They live in Long Island, and Pandora lived in California. That 's right over the other side of the United States. " " Does Edie know her? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little girl as well. " " What does she look like? " " Heavens above, Henry, I 've never met her, so I ca n't tell you. But you p238 know that picture in the dining-room at Croy? Of the pretty girl? Well, that 's Pandora when she was young. " " I hope she 's still pretty " " You like pretty ladies. " " Well, I certainly do n't like ugly ones. " He screwed up his face, making a monster grimace. " Like that Lottie Carstairs. " Despite herself, Virginia had to laugh. " You know something, Henry Aird, you 'll be the death of me. Now, hand me your hairbrush, and then go and wash your hands. " From the foot of the stairs, Edmund called, " Virginia. " " We 're on our way! " He waited for them, dressed for the occasion in grey flannels, a country shirt, a club tie, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We should go. " Reaching his side, Virginia kissed him. " You 're looking handsome, Mr. Aird. Did you know that? " " You 're not looking so gruesome yourself. Come along, Henry. " They got into the BMW and drove. They stopped for a moment in the village, where Edmund went into Mr, Ishak 's and emerged with the bulky wodge of the Sunday newspapers. Then on to Pennyburn. Vi heard them coming and was ready for them, on the point of locking her front door. Edmund leaned over to open the door for her and she got in beside him. Henry thought she was looking very smart and told her so. " Thank you, Henry. This is the pretty scarf your mother brought me from London. " " I know. She brought me a cricket bat and a ball. " " You showed me. " " And she brought Edie a cardigan, Edie loves it. She says she 's keeping it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Lilac, " Virginia told him. " Lilac. " He said the word over to himself because it had a pleasant sound. Lilac. The powerful car left Pennyburn behind and sped on up the hill, Arriving, they found Archie 's old Land Rover parked in front of the house, As Edmund drew up alongside and the Aird family disgorged from his car, Archie appeared at the open front door, come to greet them. They made their way up the steps. " Well, here you are. " " You 're looking very formal, Archie, " Edmund told him. " I hope I 'm not underdressed. " p239 " Been to church. Read the lesson. I thought about changing into something a little less stuffy, but now you 've arrived, so there is n't time. So you 'll have to take me as I am. Vi. Virginia. Lovely to see you. Hello, Henry, good morning. How are you? Hamish is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scalectrix Road Race up on the floor of the playroom. If you want to go and have a look at it... " The suggestion, casually made, was adroit and caught Henry 's attention, as Archie knew it would. He had no qualms about his son, who had been warned that Henry was coming, and had it made clear to him that he was to behave towards this small guest in a hospitable fashion. As for Henry, it took only an instant to remember that Hamish, provided there was nobody else around to claim his attention, could be quite good company, even though Henry was four years younger. And Henry had n't got a Scalectrix Road Race. It was one of the things he was thinking of putting on his Christmas list. His face brightened. He said " All right " and set off at a fast clip, up the stairs, leaving the grown-ups to their own devices. " Brilliant, " murmured Vi, as though to herself. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have this morning? " " Sixteen, including the rector. " " I should have been there to swell the throng. Now I 'm going to have a conscience for the rest of the day.... " " But it 's not all bad news. The Bishop 's come up trumps and ferreted out some obscure trust, set up years ago. He thinks he can wangle a sizy sum from that, which would pay off the balance of the bill for the elee-tries.... " " Would n't that be splendid? " " But, " said Virginia, " I thought that was why we had the church sale... " " We can always divert funds.... " Edmund made no comment. It had been a long morning, deliberately filled with small and insignificant tasks that nevertheless had been demanding his attention for some weeks. Letters written, accounts paid, a query from his chartered accountant clarified and answered. Now, he found himself dealing with a growing impatience. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double doors of the library stood invitingly open. He looked forward to a gin and tonic, but Archie, Virginia, and Vi, loosely grouped at the foot of the stairs, had become absorbed by churchly problems. In these Edmund had little interest, having always taken great pains never to become involved... of course, we do need new kneelers. " 240 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p240 " Vi, paying for the coke for the boiler is more urgent than new kneel-ers.... " The real reason for their coming to Croy appeared to have been forgotten by his wife and his mother. Stifling his irritation, Edmund listened. And then did not listen. Another sound caught his attention. From the library came the tap of high heels. He looked up, over the top of Virgin-ia 's head. Saw Pandora emerge. Watching, assessing the situation, she paused, framed by the open doorway. Across the long space that divided them, her eyes met Ed-mund 's. He forgot his impatience, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been abruptly asked to produce some sort of a report and was frantically searching for, and then abandoning, suitable adjectives with which to state his case : older, thinner, attenuated, elegant, mondaine, amoral, experienced. Beautiful. Pandora. He would have seen her, recognized her, known her anywhere in the world. Still those wide and watchful eyes, the curving mouth with its provocative mole at the corner of her upper lip. The features, the bone structure were untouched by the years that had passed, the profusion of chestnut hair still youthful. He felt his face freeze. He could not smile. As though he were a gun dog pointing at a bird, the quality of his stillness, his silence, obscurely reached the others. Their attention wandered, their voices died away. Vi turned her head. " Pandora. " The church and its affairs were abandoned. She moved away from Virginia 's side, across the polished parquet, her back view erect, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its strap from her elbow. " Pandora, my dearest child. What a joy. What a delight to see you again. ".. but Isobel, you ca n't possibly have us all for dinner. That 's far too many. " " No. If my counting 's right, we 'll be eleven. That 's only one more than we are now. " " Has Verena not lumbered you with people to stay? " " Just one man. p241 Pandora chipped in. " He 's known as The Sad American, ' because Isobel ca n't remember what his name is. " " Poor chap, " said Archie from the head of the table. " Sounds as though he 's doomed before he 's even arrived. " " Why is he sad? " asked Edmund, reaching for his glass of lager. At Croy, wine was never served at luncheon. This was not for any reason of parsimony but because of a family tradition, going back to Archie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it because he thought it a sound idea. Wine was apt to render guests both garrulous and comatose, and Sunday afternoons, in his opinion, were made to be spent in useful outdoor activities, not snoozing over the newspapers in some armchair. " He probably is n't sad at all, " Isobel told him. " He 's probably a very sensible, cheerful fellow, but he 's been recently widowed and he 's taken a couple of months off, and has come over here for a bit of a break. " " Does Verena know him? " " No. But Katy does. She felt sorry for him and asked Verena to send him an invitation. " Pandora said, " I do hope he 's not dreadfully solemn and sincere. You know how they can be. Show them round a sewage works and they 'll go into polite ecstasies. Swearing it was all very very interesting, and wanting to know when it was built. " Archie laughed. " Pandora, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sewage works? " " Oh, darling, never. Just giving a tiny example. " They sat around the dining-room table. The tender roast beef, perfectly cooked and pink in the middle, had been appreciatively consumed, along with fresh beans, fresh peas, roasted potatoes, horseradish sauce, and dark gravy delicately laced with red wine. Now they were onto Isobel 's blackberry fool and hot-syrup tart, drooling with fresh cream. Out of doors, the day, like a fickle woman, had ceased to sulk and decided, for no obvious reason, to brighten up. A wind had risen, freshening the air. From time to time, lozenges of sunlight fell upon the polished table, sparking from silver and cut-glass tumblers. " Well, if we all come to dinner, " Virginia firmly led the conversation back to essentials, " you must let me help. I 'll make a starter, or a pudding, or something. " " That would help, " Isobel admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to be up at Corriehill helping Verena with the flowers. " " But that 's my birthday. " Vi was quite indignant. " That 's the day of my picnic. " 242 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p242 " I know, Vi, and I 'm sorry, but for the first time in years I 'm not going to be able to be there. " " Well, I hope nobody else is going to back out. You have n't got to go and do flowers, have you, Virginia? " " No. I 've just been asked to lend my biggest flowerpots and vases. But I can take them all up to Corriehill on Wednesday. " " When does Alexa arrive? " Lucilla asked. " On Thursday morning. She and Noel are going to drive overnight. Noel ca n't get off before that. And of course they 're bringing Alexa 's dog. So they 'll all be at the picnic, Vi. " " I shall have to start writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall lose count and produce far too much food or too little. " She leaned forward and looked down the length of the table to catch Henry 's eye. Henry 's expression was gloomy. He did not like people talking about Vi 's birthday when they all knew he would not be there. She said, " I shall post two huge slices of birthday cake over to Templehall. One for Henry and one for Hamish. " " Well, make sure it 's a cake that does n't go squishy. " Hamish scraped the last spoonful of syrup tart out of his plate. " Mum sent me a cake once and all the cream oozed out through the parcel, and Matron was livid. She threw the whole lot into the Sick Bay dustbin. " " Mean old Matron, " said Pandora sympathetically. " She 's a cow. Mum, can I have some more? " " Yes, but hand it round first. " Hamish got to his feet and went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said, " We have a small problem. " Everybody looked at her, interested to know what it was but not particularly concerned. " Jeff has n't got anything to wear. To the dance, I mean. " Eyes were now turned on Jeff, who had sat through the meal without taking much part in any conversation. He looked faintly abashed and seemed pleased for the diversion of Hamish arriving at his side with the offer of second helpings of pudding. He turned to dip the spoon into what remained of the blackberry fool. He said, " When I left Australia I never thought I 'd be asked to a formal do. Besides, there was n't space in my backpack for a dinner jacket. " They all considered the problem. Archie said, " I 'd lend you mine, only I 'm wearing it myself. " " Dad, yours would n't even go round Jeff. " " He could always hire one. There are places in Relkirk... " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archie was humbled. " Sorry. I would n't know. " Across the table, Edmund eyed the young Australian. " You 're about the same size as I am. I 'll lend you something if you like. " Violet, hearing this, was taken aback. Sitting next to her son, she turned her head to look at him. He seemed unaware of her piercing regard, and his profile, composed and unsmiling, gave nothing away. Trying to analyze her un-motherly astonishment, she realized that the truth of it was that she had never expected Edmund to come up with such a kindly and impetuous suggestion. But why? He was her son, the child of Geordie. She knew that where important issues were concerned he would never be anything but gener-ous -- with both time and money -- concerned and considerate. Violet could turn to him -- and had done so many times -- knowing that he would go to endless trouble to sort out a problem or help her make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the small gesture, the tender word, the trivial gift that had cost nothing but a few pence and a moment of time, but was significant because of the thought behind it. Her eyes strayed across the table to Virginia and the heavy gold bracelet that she wore around her wrist. Edmund had given her that bracelet -- and Violet did not like to think what it had cost -- like a tube of glue, to patch up their disagreement. But how much better had they not quarrelled in the first place, and so spared themselves weeks of unhappiness. And now he was offering Lucilla 's Jeff a favour. It would be no hardship to him, but the offer had been made so spontaneously that Violet was reminded of Geordie. Which should have filled her with pleasure, but instead left her sad because she could not remember when she had last looked at Edmund and recognized any characteristic inherited from his gentle father. As for Jeff, he seemed as disconcerted as she was herself. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just hire something. " " No skin off my nose. I 've some spare things at Balnaid. You can try them on, see how they fit. " " But wo n't you need them yourself? " " I shall be decked out, like the man on a shortbread tin, in my kilt. " Lucilla, however, was deeply grateful. " You are a saint, Edmund. What a relief. Now all I have to do is find some garment to wear. " " Isobel and I are going shopping for finery in Relkirk, " Pandora told her. " Why do n't you come too? " Lucilla, surprising everybody, said, " I 'd love to. " But their surprise was short-lived. " There 's a wonderful market in Relkirk, and a stall 244 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p244 stuffed with glorious nineteen-thirties tat. I 'm sure I 'll find something there. " " Yes, " said her mother. " I am quite sure that you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've bashed me right into the rhododen-drons. " " I wanted to get you out of the way. " " You did n't need to hit me quite so far. " " Yes, I did. You 're far too cunning a player to be left jostling around the hoop. Now, Virginia, you need to come just here. " " Which blade of grass did you have in mind? " Isobel 's lunch party, with coffee drunk, had amicably dispersed. The boys, abandoning Scalectrix, had gone to play in Hamish 's tree-house, and swing on his trapeze. Isobel had taken Vi to look at her border. :. not as grand or imposing as it had been in the old days but still something that she was always quite proud to show off and have admired. Archie, Virginia, Lucilla, and Jeff had decided to take advantage of Ham-ish 's labour and were engaged in a needle contest of croquet. Edmund and Pandora sat in the old swing-seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. It had turned into a pleasant and blowy afternoon. Clouds, in layers, drifted across the sky, but there were wide patches of blue in between, and when the sun shone, it became very warm. Despite this, Pandora, on her way out into the garden, had collected from the cloakroom an old shooting jacket of Archie 's, oiled khaki and lined with hairy tweed. Bundled in this garment, she sat with her legs tucked up beneath her. From time to time Edmund gave a push with his foot to set the old seat swinging. It needed to be oiled and made a hideous squeaking sound. A wail from the middle of the rhododendrons. " I ca n't find the beastly ball and I 've been scratched by a bramble. " " In a moment, " Edmund observed, " family fur is going to fly. " " It always did. It 's a lethal game. " They fell silent, rocking gently to and fro. Virginia took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least four yards beyond the spot that Archie had been indicating. " Oh, sorry, Archie. " " You hit it too hard. " p245 " Nothing, " said Edmund, " is so obvious as the obvious remark. " Pandora made no comment. Squeak, squeak went the swing. They watched in silence while Jeff played his shot. She said, " Do you hate me, Edmund? " " No. " " But you despise me? Think little of me? " " Why should I do that? " " Because I made such a mess of everything. Running off with another woman 's husband, and he old enough to be my father. Leaving no word of explanation, breaking my parents ' hearts, never coming back. Sending waves of shock and horror to reverberate around the county. " " Is that what happened? " " You know it is. " " I was n't here at the time. " " Of course. You were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you went flying off. " " I was miserable. I did n't know what to do with my life. Archie had gone and was married to Isobel, and I missed him. There did n't seem to be any way to turn. And then along came a little diversion, and it all seemed frightfully glamorous and grown-up. Exciting. My ego needed a boost and that 's what he provided. " " How did you meet him? " " Oh, at some party. He had a horse-faced wife called Gloria, but she scarpered pretty sharpish as soon as she saw the way the wind was blowing. Went off to Marbella and never returned. Which was another reason for eloping to California. " Lucilla, with bits of leaf in her hair, emerged from the rhododendrons and rejoined the game. " Who 's been through the hoop, and who has n't? " The seat, gradually, stopped swinging. Edmund gave another push and started it up again. Squeak, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes. " " I do n't think I was ever happy. " " I 'm sorry. " " I liked being rich but I was n't happy. I was homesick and I missed the dogs. Do you know what he was called, the man I ran away with? " " I do n't think I was ever told. " " Harold Hogg. Can you imagine anybody eloping with a man called Harold Hogg? After our divorce, the first thing I did was to change my name back to Blair. So I did n't keep his name, but I did keep much of his money. So lucky, to be divorced in California. " 246 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p246 Edmund said nothing. " And then, when it was all over, and after I 'd changed my name back to Blair, do you know what I did? " " I have no idea. " " I went to New York. I 'd never been there before, did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel I could find and then I walked down Fifth Avenue and knew that anything I wanted I could buy. For myself. And then I did n't buy anything. That 's a sort of happiness, is n't it, Edmund? Knowing that you can buy anything you want and then discovering that you do n't want it. " " Are you happy now? " " I 'm home. " " Why did you come back? " " Oh, I do n't know. Reasons. Lucilla and Jeff were there to drive me. I wanted to see Archie again. And then, of course, the irresistible lure of Verena Steynton 's party. " " I have a feeling that Verena Steynton has little to do with it. " " Perhaps. But it 's a nice excuse. " " You never came home when your parents died. " " That was unforgivable, was n't it? " " You said it, Pandora. I did n't. " " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. I could n't face funerals, graves, condolences. I could n't face anybody. And death is so final, just as youth is so sweet. I could n't bear to accept that it was all over. " " Are you happy in Majorca? " " I 'm home there too. All these years, and the Casa Rosa is the first home I 've actually owned. " " Are you going back? " All the time they had been talking, they had not looked at each other. Instead, they had watched, with patent intent, the croquet players. But now he turned to face her, and her head came around, and her remarkable eyes, fringed with thick black lashes, stared into his own. Perhaps it was because she had become so painfully thin, but they seemed to Edmund more enormous and lustrous than they had ever been. She said, " Why do you ask? " " I do n't know. " " Perhaps I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the faded striped cushions and returned her attention to the croquet. Their conversation, such as it was, appeared to be over. Edmund watched his wife. She stood in the middle of the verdant lawn, leaning on her mallet, while Jeff lined up to play a tricky shot. p247 She wore a checked shirt and a short blue denim skirt, and her legs were long and bare and brown, and her canvas sneakers very white. Fit, slender, bursting into laughter at Jeff 's abortive attempt to get his ball through the hoop, she radiated the sort of vitality that Edmund associated with glossy magazine advertisements for sports clothes, Rolex watches, or sun-tan oil. Virginia. My love, he told himself. My life. But for some reason the words were empty as incantations that were never going to work, and he found himself racked by despair. Pandora had fallen silent. He could not imagine what she thought about. He turned to look at her and it took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast asleep. So much for his entertaining company. He was torn between chagrin and amusement, and this healthy reaction to her perfidy served to fend off for the time being the deadly sensation that he had come to the end of his rope. p248 Monday the Twelfth MONDAY WAS ONE OF EDIE 'S MORNINGS for helping Virginia at Balnaid, and Virginia was grateful for this arrangement. She had never relished Mondays, with the weekend over and Edmund gone from her once more, dressed in his city suit, and leaving the house at eight o'clock in order to get into Edinburgh and his office before the worst of the rushhour traffic. His departure left an emptiness, a flatness, a sense of anticlimax, and it was always something of an effort to get down to day-to-day living again and cope with all the tedious demands of simply keeping the house going. But hearing the bang of the back door as Edie let herself in always made everything, instantly, a bit more bearable. To know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, someone to laugh with, someone to dust the library and vacuum the dog hairs off the hall carpet. The clatter from the kitchen was comforting. Edie, dealing with the breakfast dishes, loading the washing-machine with a weekend 's worth of dirty clothes, and talking to the dogs. " Now do n't you get under my feet, or you 'll get your tail trodden on. " Virginia, in her bedroom, changed the sheets on their big double bed, her regular Monday-morning chore. Henry had gone shopping. His mother had given him five pounds, and he had set off to the village, to visit Mrs. Ishak, and buy the allotted amount of sweets, chocolates, and biscuits that he was permitted to take to Templehall in his tuck-box, and which were meant to last him for a full term. He had never before been given so much money to spend on sweets, and the novelty of this, for the moment, had diverted his attention from the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eight years old and going away. Not for ever, it was true. But Virginia knew that when she saw him again, he would already be a different Henry because he would have seen things p249 and done things and learned things totally dissociated from his mother 's life. Tomorrow, he was going. The first day of ten years of regular separation from his parents and his home. The beginning of his growing up. Up and away from her. She folded pillowcases. They had only another twenty-four hours. All through the weekend she had resolutely put his inevitable departure out of her mind ; pretended to herself that Tuesday was never going to happen. Henry, she guessed, had done the same, and her heart bled for his innocence. Last night, saying good night to him, she had steeled herself for a dam-burst of tears and lamentations. The weekend 's over. Our last weekend. I do n't want to go to school. I do n't want to leave you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite liked playing with Hamish, he 'd hung by one leg from Hamish 's trapeze ; and then, worn out by the day 's activity, had fallen almost instantly asleep. She spread crisp, ironed sheets. I 'll get through today and make it fun for him, she told herself. And then, somehow, I 'll get through tomorrow. After Edmund has taken Henry, after they 've driven away and I ca n't hear the car any longer, I 'll think of something diverting or industrious to do. I 'll go and see Dermot Honeycombe and spend hours looking for a present for Katy Steynton. A bit of china, or an antique lamp, or perhaps a little piece of Georgian silver. I 'll write a long letter to Gramps and Grandma. I 'll turn out the linen cupboard, sew buttons on Edmund 's shirts..,. And then Edmund will come home, and after that the worst will be over, and I can start counting the days until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soiled sheets and flung them out onto the landing, then put away a few random clothes and shoes, straightened a cushion. The telephone rang. She went to answer it, sitting on the edge of the freshly made bed. " Balnaid. " " Virginia. " It was Edmund. At a quarter past nine in the morning? " Are you in the office? " " Yes. Got here ten minutes ago. Virginia. Look. I have to go to New York. " She was not particularly perturbed. His flying off to New York was a regular occurrence. " When? " " Now. Today. I 'm catching the first shuttle down to London. Flying out of Heathrow this afternoon. " " But? " 250 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p250 " I 'll be back at Balnaid on Friday in time for the party. Probably about six in the evening. Earlier if I can make it. " " You mean... " It was difficult actually to take in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be away all week? " " That 's right. " " But... packing.. clothes... " Which was ridiculous because she knew that he kept a duplicate wardrobe in the flat at Moray Place, with suits, shirts, and underclothes suitable for any capital and any cli-mate. " I 'll do that here. " " But... " The implication, the truth of what he was saying, broke at last. He ca n't do this to me. The bedroom window was open and the air that flowed through it was not cold, but Virginia, hunched over the telephone, shivered. She saw the knuckles of her hand, clenched around the receiver, grow white. " Tomorrow, " she said. " Tuesday. You 're taking Henry to Templehall. " " I ca n't do that. " " You promised. " " I have to go to New York. " " Somebody else can go. Not you. " " There 's nobody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to be me. " " But you promised. You said that you would take Henry. I told you that it was the one thing that I would n't do. It was my condition and you accepted it. " " I know, and I 'm sorry. But what 's happened is beyond my control. " " Send somebody else to New York. You 're the boss. Send some under-ling. " " It 's because I am who I am that I have to go. " " You are who you are! " She heard her own voice, shrill with scathing. " Edmund Aird. You think of nobody but yourself and nothing but your hateful job. Sanford Cubben. I hate Sanford Cubben. I realize I come fairly low on your priority list, but I thought Henry rated a little higher. You did n't only promise me, you promised Henry. Does that mean nothing to you? " " I did n't promise anything. I just said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " " I call that a commitment. If you made such a commitment in business, you 'd kill yourself to see it through. " " Virginia, be reasonable. " " I will not be reasonable! I will not sit here and listen to you and be told to be reasonable. And I will not deliver my child to a boarding- p251 school that I never wanted him to go to in the first place. It 's like asking me to take one of the dogs to the vet to be put down. I wo n't do it! " By now she was sounding like a fishwife, and did not care. But Ed-mund 's voice remained, as always, infuriatingly cool and dispassionate. " In that case, I suggest that you call Isobel Balmerino and ask her to take Henry. She 's driving Hamish. She 'll have plenty of space for Henry. " " If you think I 'm going to palm Henry off onto Isobel? " " Then you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bastard, Edmund. You know that, do n't you? You 're behaving like a selfish bastard. " " Where is Henry? I 'd like to speak to him before I go. " " He 's not here, " Virginia told him with a certain malicious satisfaction. " He 's buying his sweets from Mrs. Ishak. " " Well, when he comes home, tell him to ring me at the office. " " You can ring him yourself. " And on this biting exit line, she slammed down the receiver and put an end to the miserable exchange. Her raised voice had penetrated to the kitchen. " What was that all about? " Edie asked, turning from the sink as Virginia stormed in with a face like thunder, and arms filled with rumpled linen, to stride across the kitchen towards the open door of the utility room and hurl her burden in the general direction of the washing-ma-chine. " Is something wrong? " " Everything. " Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her expression mutinous. " That was Edmund, and he 's going to New York today. Now. And he 's going to be away a week, and he promised me.. he promised, Edie... that he 'd drive Henry to school tomorrow. I told him that it was the one thing I would n't do. I 've hated the whole idea of Templehall from the very beginning, and the only reason I finally relented was because Edmund promised that he would take Henry tomor-row. " Edie knew a nasty temper when she saw one. She said reasonably, " Well, I suppose if you 're an important business man these things are bound to happen. " " Only to Edmund. Other men manage their lives without being so bloody selfish. " " You do n't want to take Henry yourself? " " No, I do not. It 's the last thing in the world I want to do. It 's inhuman of Edmund to expect it of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem. p252 " Could you not ask Lady Balmerino to take him with Hamish? " Virginia did not let on that Edmund had already made this sensible suggestion and got an earful for his pains. " I do n't know. " She thought about it. " I suppose I could, " she admitted sulkily. " Isobel 's very understanding. And she 's been through it herself. " " No, she has n't. " It was obvious to Edie that she could say nothing right. " Hamish was never like Henry. You could send Hamish to the moon, and all he 'd worry about would be when he was going to get his next meal. " " That 's true enough. But if I were you, I 'd have a word with Isobel. It 's no good working yourself up into a state if there 's nothing to be done. What? " " I know, Edie. What ca n't be cured must be endured. " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to get the kettle and fill it with water. A cup of tea seemed to be in order. There was nothing, in times of stress, like a good hot cup of tea. They were drinking the tea when Henry returned, his carrier-bag bulging with goodies. " Mummy, look what I got! " He emptied the contents out onto the kitchen table. " Look, Edie. Mars Bars, and Smarties, and Cadbury 's Dairy Milk, and some Jellybabies, and Jaffa Cakes, and Chocolate Digestives, and treacle toffees, and Rolos ; and Mrs. Ishak gave me a lollipop for going away. I did n't have to pay for the lollipop, so can I eat it now? " Edie surveyed his loot. " I hope you 're not going to eat that lot all at once, otherwise you wo n't have a tooth left in your head. " " No. " He was already unwrapping the lollipop. " It 's got to last a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. She put her arm around Henry and said, in consciously cheerful tones, " Daddy phoned. " He licked. " What about? " " He has to go to America. Today. He 's flying from London this afternoon. So he wo n't be able to take you to school tomorrow. But I thought I 'd... " Henry stopped licking. His pleasure flowed from his face, and he turned enormous, apprehensive eyes upon his mother. She hesitated, and then started up again. "... I thought I 'd ring Isobel and ask if she 'd take you with Hamish.. She got no further. His reaction to the news was even worse than she had dreaded. A wail of dismay and floods of instant tears... " I do n't want Isobel to take me.... " p253 " Henry.. He jerked himself out of her embrace and flung his lollipop onto the floor. " I 'm not going to go with Isobel and Hamish. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. How would you like it, if you were me and... " " Henry... " "... you had to go away with people who were n't your own mother and father? I think you are being very unkind to me.... " " I 'll take you. " " And Hamish will be horrid and not talk because he 's a senior. It 's not fair! " Furiously weeping, he turned and fled for the door. " Henry, I 'll take you.... " But he was gone, his footsteps stamping up the stairs to the sanctuary of his bedroom. Virginia, gritting her teeth, closed her eyes and wished that she could close her ears as well. It came. The deadly slam of his bedroom door. Then silence. She opened her eyes and met Edie 's across the table. Edie gave a long sigh. She said, " Oh, dearie dear. " " So much for that bright idea. " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned her elbow on the table and ran a hand through her hair. All at once the situation had become more than she felt able to cope with. She said, " This is the very last thing I wanted to happen. " She knew, and Edie knew, that Henry 's tantrums, though rare, left him vulnerable and touchy for hours. " I wanted this to be a good day, and not miserable. Our last day together. And now Henry 's going to spend it bursting into tears and blaming me for everything. As if things were n't bad enough. Damn Edmund. What am I going to do, Edie? " " How would it be, " said Edie, " if I just came back this afternoon and took Henry off your hands? He 's never so bad with me. Have you finished his packing yet? Well, I could finish his packing and do any wee bits that need to be done, and he can just be around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet day, that 's what he needs. " " Oh, Edie. " Virginia was filled with grateful love. " Would you do that? " " No trouble. Mind, I 'll have to go home and see to Lottie, give her her dinner, but I 'll be here again by two. " " Ca n't Lottie see to her own dinner? " " Well, she can, but she makes such a hash of it, burns the pans, and leaves my kitchen in a midden, I 'm better to do it myself. " 254 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p254 Virginia was repentant. " Oh, Edie. You do so much. I 'm sorry I shouted at you. " " Good thing I was here for you to shout at. " She heaved herself onto her swollen legs. " Now, I must get on, or we wo n't get the baby bathed at this rate. Up you go and have a word with Henry. Tell him he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd really like would be one of his bonny pictures. " Virginia found Henry, as she knew she would, under his duvet with Moo. She said, " I 'm sorry, Henry. " Racked with huge sobs, he did not reply. She sat on his bed. " It was a silly thing to suggest. Daddy suggested it to me, and I thought it was silly then. I had no right even to mention it to you. Of course you wo n't go with Isobel. You 'll come with me. I 'll take you in the car. " She waited. After a bit, Henry rolled onto his back. His face was swollen and tear-stained, but he seemed to have stopped crying. He said, " I do n't mind so much about Hamish, but I want you. " " I 'll be there. Perhaps we 'll take Hamish with us. It would be kind. Save Isobel a journey. " He sniffed. " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. She said she 'd like to spend the afternoon with you. She wants you to draw her a picture. " " Have you packed my felt pens? " " Not yet. " He put out his arms, and she gathered him up and held him close, rocking him gently, pressing kisses onto the top of his head. After a bit, he emerged from beneath his duvet, and they found a handkerchief and he blew his nose. It was not until then that she remembered Edmund 's message. " Daddy wanted you to ring him up. He 's at the office. You know the number. " Henry went to her bedroom to do this, but Virginia had left it too late and Edmund had already gone. The playroom was peaceful and warm. Sun poured through the wide windows, and the breeze sent the wistaria branches tapping at the panes. Henry sat at the big table in the middle of the room, and drew. Edie was on the window-seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p255 socks. In the mornings, for work, Edie wore her oldest clothes and a pinafore, but this afternoon she had turned up looking quite smart, and had put on her new lilac cardigan. Henry felt flattered, because he knew that she was keeping it for best. As soon as she arrived, she had set up the ironing-board, and ironed the morning 's load of washing, fresh from the line. This was now stacked, crisp and folded, on the other end of the table, and emanated a pleasant smell. Henry laid down his felt pen and searched in his pen-box, making scrabbling sounds. He said, " Bother. " " What is it, pet? " " I want a Biro. I 've drawn people with balloons coming out of their mouths, and I want to write what they 're saying. " " Look in Edie 's bag. There 's a pen in there. " Her bag was on the chair by the fireside. It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important things : her comb, her fat housekeeping purse, her Old Age Pension book, her Post Office Savings book, her rail-card, her bus pass. She did n't have a car, so she had to go everywhere by bus. Because of this she had a timetable, a little booklet, " Relkirkshire Bus Company. " Henry, rooting for the pen, came upon this. It occurred to him, out of the blue, that it might be a sensible and useful thing to own. Edie probably had another at home. He looked up at Edie. She was intent on her sewing, her white head bowed. He removed the booklet from her bag and slipped it into the pocket of his jeans. He found the Biro, closed her bag, and went back to his work. Presently, Edie asked, " What would you like for your tea? " He said, " Macaroni cheese. " Dermot Honeycombe 's antique shop stood at the far end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at the foot of a gentle slope that leaned between the road and the river. Once it had been the village smithy, and the cottage where Dermot lived, the blacksmith 's house. Dermot 's cottage was painfully picturesque. It had tubs of begonias at the door, latticed windows, and a thickly thatched roof. But the shop was much as it had always been, with walls of dark stone and blackened beams. Outside was a yard of cobbles where once the patient farm horses had stood, waiting to be shod, and here Dermot had set up his shop sign, p256 an aged wooden cart, painted blue, with DERMOT HONEYCOMBE ANTIQUES emblazoned tastefully on its side. It was an eye-catching gimmick, and brought in much casual trade. It was also useful for tying dogs to. Virginia clipped the leads onto the spaniels ' collars, and knotted the ends around one of the cartwheels. The dogs sat, looking reproachful. " I sha n't be long, " she told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes made her feel like a murderer, but she left them and went across the cobbles and in through the door of the old smithy. Here Dermot sat, in his paper-piled birdcage of an office. He was on the telephone but spied her through the glass, raised a hand, and then reached out to turn on a switch. Within the shop, four dangling bulbs sprang to light, doing a little to alleviate the gloom, but not very much. The place bulged with every sort of junk. Chairs were piled on tables, on the tops of chests of drawers. Huge wardrobes towered. There were milk churns, jelly pans, stacks of unmatched china, brass fenders, corner cupboards, curtain rails, cushions, bundles of velvet, threadbare rugs. The smell was damp and musty, and Virginia knew a small frisson of anticipation. Visits to Dermot 's were always something of a lottery because you never knew -- and neither did Dermot -- what you might, by chance, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the tottering stacks of furniture, with the wary caution of a pot-holer. Already, she felt marginally more cheerful. Browsing was a comforting therapy, and Virginia allowed herself the self-indulgence of putting Edmund, the morning 's traumas, and tomorrow, all out of her mind. A present for Katy. Her eye wandered. She priced a chest of drawers, a wide-lapped chair. Searched for the silver mark on a battered spoon, poked through a box of old keys and brass doorknobs, turned the pages of a dignified old wreck of a book. Found a lustre cream jug, and wiped the dust from it, searching for chips or cracks. There were none. She was joined by Dermot, finished with his telephone call. " Hello, my dear. " " Dermot. Hello. " " Looking for something in particular? " " A present for Katy Steynton. " She held up the lustre jug. " This is sweet. " " It 's a pet, is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that dark gentian blue. " He was a rotund, smooth-faced man of mature years, but strangely ageless. His cheeks were pink, and his fluffy pale hair airy as dandelion down. He wore a faded green corduroy jacket, much adorned with drooping poachers ' pockets, and had a red-spotted kerchief tied in a p257 jaunty knot around his neck. " You 're the second person I 've had in today looking for something for Katy. " " Who else has been here? " " Pandora Blair. Popped in this morning. Lovely to see her again. Could n't believe it when she walked through the door. Just like old times. And after all these years! " " We had lunch at Croy yesterday. " Virginia thought about yesterday, and knew that it had been a good day, the sort they would all remember when they were old and there was nothing much left to do but reminisce. It was the time when Pandora came home from Majorca, and Lucilla was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name. And we played croquet. And Edmund and Pandora sat in the swing seat, and Pandora went to sleep, and we all teased Edmund for being such a boring companion. " That 's the first time I 'd met Pandora. " " Of course. Amazing. How the years fly by. " " What did she buy for Katy? I must n't get the same. " " A lamp. Chinese porcelain, and I 'd made the shade for it myself. White silk, lined in palest pink. Then we had a cup of coffee and caught up on all the news. She was ever so sad when I told her about Terence. " " I 'm sure. " Virginia was afraid that Dermot 's eyes were about to swim with tears, and went on hurriedly, " Dermot, I think I 'll have this jug. Katy can use it either for cream or flowers, yet it 's pretty enough on its own. " " Do n't think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Have a snoop around... " I 'd love to, but I 'm taking the dogs for a walk. I 'll pick the jug up on my way home, and write you a cheque for it then. " " Righty ho. " He took the jug from her and led the devious way back towards the door. " Are you going to Vi 's picnic on Thursday? " " Yes. Alexa will be there too. She 's bringing a friend up for the dance. " " Oh, lovely. Have n't seen Alexa for months. I 'm going to see if I can get someone to mind the shop for me that day. If I ca n't, I 'll shut it up. Would n't miss Vi 's picnic for anything. " " I hope it 's a good day. " They emerged and stepped out into the sunshine. The dogs, spying them, wheaked blissfully and leaped to their feet, tangling the leads. " How 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to New York. " " I do n't believe it! What a thing! I would n't have his job for all the tea in China. " " Do n't waste your sympathy. He loves it. " i p258 She rescued the dogs, waved goodbye to Dermot, walked on, leaving the last straggling cottages of Strathcroy behind her. Another half mile and she had come to the bridge that spanned the river at the west end of the village. The bridge was ancient, steeply humpbacked, and once used by cattle-drovers. On the far side, a winding, tree-shaded lane followed the convolutions of the river, and led the way back to Balnaid. On the crest of the bridge she paused to loosen the dogs and let them run free. They shot off at once, noses enticed by the smell of rabbits, to plunge into a thicket of bracken and brambles. Every now and then, as though to prove they were not wasting their time, they made hunting calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ears flying like furry wings. Virginia let them go. They were Edmund 's gun dogs, patiently trained, intelligent and obedient. A single whistle and they would return to her. The old bridge was a pleasant spot to loiter. The stone wall felt warm in the sunshine, and she leaned her arms on this and gazed downwards at the flowing peat-brown water. Sometimes she and Henry played Poohsticks from this bridge, flinging sticks upstream and then racing back to watch for the first, the winning stick, to appear. Sometimes the sticks never did appear, having been caught up in some unseen obstruction. Like Edmund. Alone, with only the river for company, she felt strong enough to think about Edmund, by now probably winging his way over the Atlantic towards New York, drawn, as though by a magnet, away from his wife and his son, just at a time when he was most needed at home. The magnet was his work, and right now Virginia felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone to keep an assignation with a mistress. Which was strange because she had never been jealous of other women, never tortured herself with imaginings of infidelity during the long periods when Edmund was away from her, in far-flung cities on the other side of the world. Once, teasing, she had told him that she did n't care what he did, provided she was n't expected to watch. All that mattered was that he always came home. But today, she had slammed down the telephone receiver and never said goodbye, and then forgotten, until too late, to give Henry his father 's message. Experiencing a twinge of guilt, she gathered her hurt feelings about her. It 's his own fault. Let him brood. Perhaps another time he 'll " Out for a walk, are you? " The voice came from nowhere. Virginia thought, oh, God, let a few seconds pass, and then slowly turned. Lottie stood only a few feet away. She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, the way that p259 Virginia had, soft-footed, unheard. Had she seen Virginia in the street, watching from Edie 's window, reached for her horrible beret, her green cardigan, and followed? Had she been waiting while Virginia was with Dermot, ducking out of sight and then dogging Virginia 's footsteps, always just out of earshot? The very idea was spooky. What did she want? Why could she not leave people alone? And why, beyond Virginia 's irritation, lurked, like a ghost, a sense of presentiment, a foreboding of fear? Ridiculous. She pulled herself together. Imagination. It was only Edie 's cousin, avid for company. With some effort, Virginia put a friendly expression on her face. " What are you doing here, Lottie? " " Fresh air belongs to everybody, I always say. Looking at the water? " She moved to Virginia 's side, to lean over the wall as she had been doing. But she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and crane her neck. " Seen any fish? " " I was n't looking for fish. " " Been to Mr. Honeycombe 's, have n't you? Lot of rubbish he 's got in there. Most of it only fit for a bonfire. But then, there 's no accounting for tastes. And as for what I 'm doing, I 'm out for a walk, same as you. On your own, Edie tells me over dinner. Edmund gone to America. " " Just for a few days. " " That 's not so nice. On business, is he? " " He would n't go for any other reason. " " Oh, ho, ho, that 's what you think. Saw Pandora Blair this morning. Thin, is n't she? Like a scarecrow. And that hair! Looks like dyed to me. Called out to her but she did n't see me. Had dark glasses on. Could have had a good old chin-wag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, you know, resident housemaid. Old Lady Balmerino then. She was a lovely lady. Felt sorry for her, with a daughter no better than she should be. That was the time of the wedding. Lord and Lady Balmerino, but they were Archie and Isobel then. There was a dance at Croy the evening of the wedding. What a work. So many people staying you could n't turn round. Course, Mrs. Harris was cook, old Lady Balmerino did n't have to cook. There were some fine goings-on, but no doubt you 've been told. " " Yes, " said Virginia, and tried to think of some way in which she could escape this unwelcome flood of words. " Scarcely out of school she was, Pandora, but she knew a thing or two, I can tell you. Men. She 'd eat them for breakfast, and leave them chewed. A right wee whore. " She was smiling, her tones inconsequent and chatty, almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and surprised her into 260 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p260 saying, quite sharply, " Lottie, I do n't think you should say that about Pandora. " " Oh, you do n't? " Lottie was still smiling. " Not pleasant, is it, hearing the truth? Nice Pandora 's back, everybody is saying. But if I were you, I would n't be too happy. Not with your husband. Not with her. Lovers they were, Edmund and Pandora. That 's why she 's back, mark my words. Come back for him. Eighteen years old, and Edmund a married man and the father of a wee bairn, but that did n't stop them. That did n't stop him, rutting in her own bed. Night of the wedding it was, and everybody dancing. But they were n't dancing. Oh, no. They were up the stair and thinking nobody noticed. But I noticed. Not much missed me. " Pink spots burned on Lottie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nails, hammered into the sockets of her head. " I went after them. Stood at the door. It was dark. I heard. Never heard anything like it. You did n't guess, did you? He 's a cool fish, that Edmund. Never let on. Never say a word. Just like the rest of them. They all knew. Well, it was obvious, was n't it? Edmund back in London and Pandora sulking in her bedroom, face swollen with tears, would n't eat. And the way she spoke to her mother! But, of course, they 're all thick as thieves. That 's why Lady Balmerino gave me my notice. Did n't want me around. I knew too much. " Still smiling. Hot with excitement. Mad. I must, Virginia told herself, keep very calm. She said, " Lottie, I think you are making all this up. " Lottie 's demeanour, with quite startling suddenness, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile was wiped from her face. She backed away from Virginia and stood, four-square, facing up to her as though they were about to engage in a contest of physical strength. " And why do you think your husband 's suddenly taken himself off to America? You ask him when he comes home to you, and I 'll doubt you 'll enjoy his answer. I 'm sorry for you, do you know that? Because he 'll make a fool of you, same as he did his first wife, poor lady. There 's no streak of decency in him. " And then, abruptly, it was over. Her venom spent, Lottie seemed to slump within herself. The colour seeped from her cheeks. She pursed her lips, brushed a scrap of lichen from the front of her cardigan, tucked a wisp of hair under her beret, patted it into place. Her expression became complacent, as though all were now well, and she was content to prink. Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head and gave a little laugh. " Ask any of them. " " You are lying. " " Say what you please. Sticks and stones may break my bones... " " I shall say nothing. " p261 Lottie shrugged. " In that case, what 's all the fuss about? " " I shall say nothing and you are lying. " Her heart was banging in her chest, her knees trembling. But she turned her back on Lottie and began to walk away ; walking steadily and without haste, knowing that Lottie watched, determined to give her no satisfaction. The worst was never looking back. Her scalp crawled with terrified apprehension, the fear that, at any moment, she would feel Lot-tie 's weight leap upon her shoulders, dragging her to the ground with all the inhuman strength of a clawed monster from childhood nightmares. This did not happen. She reached the far bank of the river, and felt a little safer. She remembered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but her mouth and her lips were too dry for whistling, and she had to try again. A tiny piping sound, a pathetic effort, but Edmund 's spaniels had had enough of abortive rabbiting, and almost immediately appeared, bounding through the bracken towards her, trailed with goosegrass and with twigs of thorny bramble entwined in their feathery fur. She had never been so glad to see them, so grateful for their instant obedience. " Good dogs. " She stopped to fondle them. " Good to come. Time to go home. " They ran ahead, down the lane. Leaving the bridge behind her, Virginia went after them, her pace still resolutely unhurried. She did not allow herself to look back until she reached the bend of the river, where the lane curved away beneath the trees. There, she stopped and turned. The bridge was still visible but there was no sign of Lottie. She was gone. It was over. Virginia took a deep breath and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not far from panic. Then the panic took over, and, without shame, she bolted for home. Ran to Edie, to Henry, to the sanctuary of Balnaid. Back to the beginning. You are lying. Two o'clock in the morning and Virginia was still awake, her eyes, scratchy with fatigue, wide open, staring out into the soft darkness. She had tossed and turned, been either too hot or too cold, fought with pillows lumpy with pummelling. From time to time, she got out of the bed, wandered about in her night-gown, fetched a glass of water, drank it, tried again to sleep. 262 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p262 It was no good. On the far side of the bed, Edmund 's side, Henry slumbered peacefully. Virginia, defiantly breaking one of Edmund 's strictest rules, had taken her son to bed with her. Every now and then, as though for reassurance, she put out a hand to touch him, to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his striped pyjamas. In the huge bed, he seemed small as a baby, scarcely alive. She 'd eat them for breakfast and leave them chewed. A right wee whore. She could not get the appalling scene out of her mind. Lottie 's words went on and on, round and round like some scratchy old gramophone record, worn with playing. Circles of torment, never ceasing, never coming to any sort of conclusion. Lovers they were. Edmund a married man, and the father of a wee bairn. Edmund and Pandora. If it was true, Virginia knew that she had never imagined nor suspected for a single instant. In her innocence, she had not watched for evidence, had read no inner meaning into Edmund 's casual words, his easy demeanour. " Pandora 's home, " he had told her, pouring himself a drink and going to the refrigerator to search for ice. " We 've been asked for lunch at Croy. " And Virginia had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beefburgers for Henry 's supper. Pandora was simply Archie 's errant young sister, back from Majorca. And when the great reunion happened, she had paid little regard to the brotherly kiss Edmund had planted on Pandora 's cheek, their laughter, and the understandable affection of this greeting. And as for the rest of the day, Virginia had been more interested in the croquet game than curious to know what it was that Edmund and Pandora, watching from the swing seat, were talking about. And what did it matter what they talked about? Be sensible. So what if they had had a wild and impetuous affair and ended up in Pandora 's bed? Pandora at eighteen must have been sensational, and Edmund at the height of his virility. This is today, and adultery is no longer called adultery but extra-marital sex. Besides, it was all a long time ago. Over twenty years. And Edmund had not been unfaithful to Virginia, but to his first wife, Caroline. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. There was nothing to agonize over. Nothing... They all knew. All thick as thieves. Did n't want me around. I knew too much. Who knew? Did Archie know? Did Isobel? Did Vi know? And Edie? Because if they knew, they would have been watching, fearing perhaps that it was all going to happen all over again. Watching Edmund and p263 Pandora, Watching Virginia, their eyes filled with a pity that she had never seen. Did they worry for Virginia as they must have worried for Caroline? Did they talk amongst themselves, like conspirators, agreeing to keep the truth from Edmund 's second wife? Because if they had, then Virginia had been betrayed, and by the very people she was closest to and most relied upon. And why do you think your husband 's suddenly taken himself off to America? He 'll make a fool of you, same as he did his first wife, poor lady. This was the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone. Had he really had to fly off like that, or was New York simply a trumped-up excuse to get away from Balnaid and Virginia and to give himself time to work out his problems? His problems being that he loved Pandora, had always loved her, and now she was back and as beautiful as ever, and Edmund was once more trapped in marriage with yet another woman, Edmund was fifty, a vulnerable age for restlessness and mid-life crises. He was not a man for showing emotion, and most of the time Virginia had no idea what he was thinking about. Her own self-doubt grew to terrifying proportions. Perhaps this time he would cut his losses and run, leaving Virginia with her marriage and her life tumbling in ruins. Leaving her and Henry lost in the rubble of what she had once thought totally impregnable. It did not bear thinking about. She rolled over, burying her face in her pillow, shutting out the ghastly prospect. She would not acknowledge it. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Lottie. This is where we came in. Back to the beginning. p264 Tuesday the Thirteenth THE RAIN WAS CRUEL, RELENTLESS, and unwelcome. It had started before daybreak, and Virginia awoke to the sound of it, and had known a dreadful sinking of the heart. As if things were n't bad enough on this dreaded day, without the elements turning against her. Perhaps it would stop. But the gods were not on anybody 's side and the downpour continued, monotonously streaming down from a charcoal-grey sky, right through the long morning and the early afternoon. Now, it was half past four, and they were on their way to Templehall. Because she had the two boys with her, and all their clobber -- trunks, tuck-boxes, duvets, rugger balls, and book-bags -- Virginia had left her own little car in the garage, and instead drove Edmund 's Subaru, a four-wheel-drive work-horse that he used when he went into rough country, or up the hill. She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfamiliarity and her own uncertainty only served to heighten the sense of doom and hopelessness that had dogged her for nearly twenty-four hours. Conditions were miserable. What light there had been was already seeping from the sky, and she drove with headlights on and the windscreen wipers working full tilt. Tyres hissed on flooded patches of road, and oncoming cars and lorries sent up great waves of blinding mud. Visibility was almost nil, which was frustrating, because under normal conditions, the road that led from Relkirk to Templehall was an exceptionally scenic drive -- through prosperous farmlands, alongside the banks of a wide and majestic river famous for its salmon, and past large estates, with distant glimpses of stately homes. It would have eased the atmosphere had they been able to observe any of this. Remarking on beauty spots, pointing out some distant peak would have given Virginia something to talk about. As it was, she had p265 tried engaging Hamish in lively conversation, hoping that this would divert Henry from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. But Hamish was in a bad mood. Knowing that the freedom of summer holidays was over was bad enough, but worse was having to go back to school in the company of a new boy. A babe. That 's what they called the little ones. The babes. Travelling with a babe was beneath Hamish 's dignity, and he just prayed that none of his contemporaries would be around to witness his humiliating arrival. He was not going to be made responsible for Henry Aird, and had made this fact vociferously clear to his mother while she helped him lug his trunk down the stairs of Croy, and flattened, with a brush, his gruesome short haircut. Accordingly, he had decided upon a course of non-communication, and had soon put a stop to Virginia 's advances by answering her in a series of non-committal grunts. She got the message, and after that the three of them had lapsed into a stony and wordless silence. Which made Virginia wish that she had n't brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sulky son. But without him there, Henry might well have succumbed to tears, sobbed throughout the journey and arrived at Templehall sodden with weeping and in no fit state to deal with the rigours of his new and daunting future. The prospect she found almost unendurable. I am hating this, she told herself. It is even worse than I imagined it would be. It is inhuman, hellish, unnatural. And worse is to come, because the moment waits when I have to say goodbye to Henry and drive away, and leave him standing, alien and alone. I hate Templehall, and I hate the headmaster, and I could strangle Hamish Blair. I have never had to do anything in my life that I have hated so much. I am hating the rain, hating the entire educational system, hating Scotland, hating Edmund. Hamish said, " There 's a car behind us. It wants to get past. " " Well, it can bloody wait, " Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later, she was back on the same road, driving the empty vehicle in the opposite direction. It was over. Henry was gone. She felt numb. Non-existent, as though the trauma of parting from him had robbed her of all identity. Just now, she would not think about Henry, because if she did she would weep, and 266 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p266 the combination of tears, half-darkness, and relentless rain would most likely cause her to drive the Subaru off the road, or into the back of a tenton lorry. She imagined the crunch of metal, her own body flung like a broken doll to the side of the road, flashing lights, the howl of ambulances and police cars. She would not think about Henry. That part of her life was over. But what was happening to her life? What was she doing here? Who was she? What was the reason for driving home to a house that stood dark and empty? She did not want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Strathcroy. But where? Somewhere perfectly gorgeous, a million miles from Archie and Isobel and Edmund and Lottie and Pandora Blair. A place of sunlight and calmness and no responsibilities, where people would tell her she was marvellous, and she could be young again instead of about a hundred years old. Leesport. That 's it. She was driving to an airport to catch a jet to Kennedy, a limousine to Leesport. It would n't be raining there. It would be Long Island autumn weather, with blue skies and golden leaves and a crisp breeze blowing in over the Bay from the Atlantic. Leesport, unchanged. The wide streets, the crossroads, the hardware store and the drugstore, with the kids outside, wheeling about on their bicycles. Then, Harbor Road. Picket fences and shade trees and sprinklers out on lawns. The road sloping to the water, the yacht anchorage a coppice of masts. The gates of the country club, and then Grandma 's house. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reality watching for the car so that she could be out on the sidewalk the moment it drew up. " Oh, honey, you 're back. " The soft, wrinkled cheek, the scent of White Linen. " It 's been too long. Did you have a good journey? What a treat to see you! " Indoors, and the other smells. Wood-smoke, sun oil, cedar, roses. Braided rugs and faded slip-covers. Cotton curtains blowing at open windows. And Grandpa coming in from the sundeck, with his glasses on top of his head and The New York Times under his arm.... " Where 's my sweetheart? " Through the murky gloom, clusters of lights now shone ahead. Relkirk. Back to reality, and Virginia now realized that here she was going to have to stop for a little. She needed to go to the loo, freshen up. Find a bar, have a drink, be made to feel human again. She needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. No reason to hurry home because there was nobody there to hurry to. A sort of free- p267 dom, perhaps. Nobody to care how late she was, nobody to worry about what she was doing. She drove into the old city. Cobbled streets were awash, rain shiminered in the street lights, pavements were crowded with shoppers and workers, booted, mackintoshed, carrying umbrellas and bags, all hurrying home to the comfort of their firesides and tea. She made for the King 's Hotel because it was familiar and she knew where to find the Ladies '. It was an old-fashioned edifice and in the middle of the town, and so had no car-park of its own. Instead, Virginia tound a space on the opposite side of the road and parked the Subaru there, beneath a dripping tree. As she locked the door, a taxi drew up outside the hotel. A man got out, wearing a raincoat and a tweed hat. He paid the driver off, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led from the pavement to the revolving door. He disappeared. Virginia paused for traffic to pass, and then ran across the road and followed him inside. The Ladies ' was on the far side of the foyer, but the man had paused at the reception desk. He had taken off his hat and was shaking the rain trom it. " Yes? " The receptionist was a sulky-looking girl, with fat pink lips and frizzy straw-coloured hair. " Good evening. I have a room booked. I called about a week ago, from London. " An American. His voice husky but lightly pitched. Something about it caught Virginia 's attention, as though a hand had tugged at her sleeve. Half-way across the floor, she paused to glance at him. Saw a tall, broadshouldered back view, dark hair streaked with grey " What name did you say? " " I did n't, but it 's Conrad Tucker. " " Oh, yes. If you 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Startled, he swung around to face her. Across the space that divided them, they stared at each other. Conrad Tucker. Older, growing grey. But Conrad. The same heavy horn-rimmed spectacles, the same indelible tan. For a second his expression remained blank, then slowly, incredulously, he smiled. " Virginia. " " I do n't believe this.... " " Well, I 'll be god-damned. " " I thought I recognized your voice. " " What are you doing here...? " 268 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p268 The boot-faced girl was not amused. " Excuse me, sir, but would you mind signing? " " I live near here. " " I never knew " " And you.,.? " " I 'm staying... " " And how will you be paying, sir? " Boot face again. " By credit card or cheque? " " Look, " said Conrad to Virginia, " this is hopeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bar and we 'll have a drink. Can you do that? Have you time? " " Yes, I have time. " " I 'll get settled, wash up, and then join you. How 's that? " " Five minutes. " " No more. The ladies ' room, frilled and chintzy, was mercifully empty, Virginia had shed her grotty old Barbour, been to the loo, and now stood at the mirror gazing at her own reflection, and feeling more disorientated than ever by the astonishing unexpectedness of her encounter with Conrad. Conrad Tucker, not seen nor thought of for twelve years or more. Here, in Relkirk. Come from London, and for what reason she could not imagine. She only knew that she had never been so glad to see a known face, because now, at least, she had someone to talk to. She was not dressed for socializing. Blue jeans and an old grey cashmere sweater with a muffler of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lank with rain, her face clean of make-up. She saw the lines on her forehead and at the corners of her mouth, and the dark bruises beneath her eyes, evidence of her sleepless night. She reached for her bag, found a comb, fixed her hair, fastened it back from her face with an elastic band. Conrad Tucker. Twelve years. She had been twenty-one. So long ago, and so much, since, had taken place, that it took some effort to recall the details of that particular summer. But they had met at the country club in Leesport. Conrad was a lawyer, in business in New York with his uncle. He had an apartment in the East Fifties, but his father owned an old house in South- p269 ampton, and Conrad had come from there to Leesport to play in some tennis championships. So far, so good. How had he played? That was lost in the mists of time. Virginia simply remembered that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had sought her out and bought her a drink, which was exactly what she had intended should happen. She searched in her bag, in vain, for a lipstick, but found scent and splashed it on. It had been a good summer. Conrad turned up in Leesport most weekends, and there were midnight barbecues and clambakes on the Fire Island beach. They played a lot of tennis, sailed Grandpa 's old sloop out onto the blue waters of the Bay. She remembered Saturday nights at the club, and dancing with Conrad on the wide terrace with the sky full of stars and the band playing " The Look of Love. " Once, mid-week, she had driven up to the City with her grandmother, to stay at the Colony Club, do a bit of shopping, and take in a show. And Conrad had phoned, and taken her out to dinner at Lespleiades, and after that they had gone on to the Cafe Carlyle and stayed until the small hours listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She picked up her bag and her Barbour and went out of the room and up the stairs and into the bar. Conrad had not yet reappeared. She bought herself a whisky and soda, a packet of cigarettes, and carried her drink to an empty table in the corner of the room. She drank half the whisky at a single go, felt at once warmed, comforted, and marginally stronger. The day was not yet over, but at least she was being offered a little respite, and she was n't alone any longer. She said, " You start, Conrad. " " Why me? " " Because before I say a single word, I have to know what you 're doing here. What has brought you to Scotland, to Relkirk? There has to be some logical explanation, but I ca n't think what it is. " He smiled. " I 'm not in fact doing anything. I 'm on a long vacation. Not exactly a sabbatical, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lawyer in New York? " " I am. " 270 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p270 " Working with your uncle? " " No. I 'm the top of the heap now. " " How impressive. Go on. " " Well... I 've been away about six weeks. Travelling in England, staying with various acquaintances. Somerset, Berkshire, London. Then I came north and I 've been in Kelso for a few days with some distant cousins of my mother 's. It 's a great place. Great fishing. Left them after lunch today. Caught the train up here. " " How long are you staying in Relkirk? " Just tonight. Tomorrow morning I 'm hiring a car, and driving on north. I have to go to a party. " " And where is the party? " " Some place called Corriehill. But I 'm staying at another house called Croy. With? " " I know. " Virginia interrupted. " Archie and Isobel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because they 're our closest friends. We all live in the same village, Strathcroy. And... you know Katy Steynton? " " I met her in London. " " You 're the Sad American. " Virginia said this without thinking and could at once have bitten out her tongue. " Sorry? " " No, Conrad. I 'm sorry. I should n't have said that. It 's just that nobody could remember your name. That 's why I did n't know it was you who was coming. " " You 've lost me. " " We had lunch with the Balmerinos on Sunday. Isobel told me about you then. " Conrad shook his head. I knew you 'd married and I knew you 'd married a Scotsman, but no more than that. I never imagined we 'd meet up like this. " " Well, here I am, Mrs. Edmund Aird. " At least I think I am. She hesitated. " Conrad, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American bit, I mean. It 's just that Isobel did n't seem to know anything about you. Except that Katy had met you in London. And that your wife had died. " Conrad was holding his whisky tumbler. He turned it in his hand, watching the amber liquid swirl. After a bit he said, " Yes. That 's right. " " I am so very sorry. " He looked up at her. He said, " Yes. " p271 " Can I ask? What happened? " " She had leukemia. She was ill for a long time. That 's why I came over. After the funeral. " " What was she called? " " Mary. " " How long were you married? " " Seven years.

" " When are you going? " " Next week sometime. " He tossed back the last of his drink, got to his feet. " I 'll get us the other half. " She watched him as he stood at the bar, ordering and paying for their second round of drinks, and tried to work out why he was so unmistakably American, when he did n't actually chew gum nor sport a crew cut. Perhaps it was his shape, the broad shoulders, narrow hips, long legs. Or his clothes. Polished loafers, chinos, a Brooks Brothers shirt, a blue Shetland sweater discreetly tagged with the Ralph Lauren logo. She heard him ask the barman for some nuts. He did this quietly and politely, and the barman found a packet and emptied them into a little dish, and Virginia remembered that Conrad seldom raised his voice and was always mannerly to any person who happened to be doing a job for him. Gas-station attendants, barmen, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd job man who carried the trash and did all the dirty jobs down at the Leesport anchorage was much taken with Conrad, because Conrad had gone to the trouble to find out his Christian name, which was Clement, and always addressed him thus. A kindly man. She thought about his dead wife, and was certain that the marriage must have been a happy one, and was angry for him. Why did tragedy always aim its venom at the couples who least deserved it while others were spared to make each other miserable and everybody else as well? Seven years. It was n't very long. But at least he had his little daughter. She thought of Henry, and was glad that he had a child. He was coming back to their table. She put a smile on her face. The whiskies looked very dark. She said, " I only meant to have one drink. I 'm driving. " " How far? " 272 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p272 " About twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband? " " He 's not at home. He 's in New York. He works for Sanford Cubben. I do n't know if that got through to you on the grape-vine or not. " " I think I did know. How about your family? " " If by family you mean kids, there 's no family at home either. I have one child, a little boy, and I have just, this very afternoon, abandoned him to start his first term at boarding-school. That is how I have spent this gruesome day. The most ghastly day of my life. That 's why I came in here. To go to the john and gather up my courage before travelling on. " Even to herself, she sounded truculent. " How old is your boy? " " Eight. " " Oh, God! " His voice was despairing, which Virginia found comforting.

I do n't know which of us was most miserable, Henry or myself. I do n't know which of us I feel most sorry for. " " Was Henry okay? Being left, I mean. Saying goodbye. " " Conrad, I do n't know. I honestly do n't know. It was the fastest turnround you could imagine. Split-second timing. Not a moment to stand, no time for a tear.

I think you did the right thing. " " Nothing could have made it any better. " She sighed, drank whisky, set down the glass. " At least neither of us had the chance to disgrace ourselves. " " I guess that 's what it 's all about. " He smiled. " But you could still do with a bit of cheering. So why do n't we have dinner together? " p273 ".. I never thought I 'd live in Scotland.

They had already eaten their Scotch broth, and were now ploughing their way through steaks, onions, chips, and mixed veg. For pudding, there was a choice of trifle or various ices. The waitress had already told them that the trifle was " offly guid. " Conrad had ordered wine, which was perhaps a mistake, and Virginia was drinking it, which was a bigger one, because she did n't usually talk as much as this, and, for the life of her, she could n't think how to stop. Even if she 'd wanted to. Because Conrad was a sympathetic listener, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the contrary, he seemed to be fascinated. She had already explained about Edmund, and his first wife, and Vi and Alexa. She had told him about Henry, about Balnaid, about the almost indescribable remoteness, and yet closeness, of their existence in Strathcroy. " What goes on there? " " Nothing, really. It 's just a little place on the way to somewhere else. And yet everything. You know how small communities are. And we have a pub and a school, and shops, and two churches, and a dear queer who sells antiques. There always seems to be something going on. A jumble sale, or a garden opening, or a school play. " It sounded dreadfully dull. She said, " It sounds dreadfully dull. " " Not a bit. Who lives there?

Croy is enormous, but he 's not in the least grand, and neither is Isobel. Isobel works harder than any woman I know, which is saying something in Scotland because all the women beaver away endlessly. If they 're not running huge houses, or bringing up children, or gardening, 274 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER. p274 then they 're organizing enormous charity events or engaged in some home industry or other. Like running farm shops and selling all their own produce, or drying flowers, or keeping bees, or restoring antiques, or making the most beautiful curtains for people. " " Do n't they ever have fun? " " Yes, they have fun, but it 's not Long Island fun, and it 's not even Devon fun. In August and September, everything comes to a rising boil and there 's a party most nights, and hunt balls and shooting and things. You 've come at the right time, Conrad, though you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. But then the winter closes in and everybody hibernates. " " How do you see your girl-friends? " " I do n't know. " She tried to work this one out. " It 's not like anywhere else. We all live such miles apart, and there 's no club life. I mean, there are n't country clubs like there are in the States. And pubs are n't the same as they are in the south. Women do n't really go into pubs. There are golf clubs, of course, but those are mostly male-orientated, and women are strictly personae non grata. You might go to Relkirk and meet a girlfriend there, but most of the socializing is done in people 's private houses. Lunch parties for the girls, and dinner parties for the couples. We all get dressed up, and like I said, drive for forty miles or more. Which is one of the reasons that life more or less stops during the winter. That 's when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can afford it, or Val d'Isere for the skiing. " " And what do you do? " " I do n't mind the winters. I hate the wet summers, but the winters are beautiful. And I go skiing up the glen. There 's a ski-area only about ten miles on from Strathcroy, with a couple of tows and some good runs. The only thing is that if there 's a lot of snow you ca n't get up the road. Which rather defeats the purpose. " " You used to ride. " " I used to hunt. For me, that was the whole purpose of riding. When I first came to Balnaid, Edmund said I could keep a couple of horses, but there did n't seem any point if there was to be no hunting. " " So how do you fill your days? " " So far, " she told him, " I 've filled them with Henry. " She gazed at Conrad, in glum hopelessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single question the sum total of all her apprehension. Henry was gone, torn from her against her will. You smother him, Edmund had told her, and she had been furiously hurt and angry, but the smothering and the mothering had been her daily occupation and her greatest joy. p275 Bereft of Henry, there was only Edmund. But Edmund was in New York, and if he was n't in New York, then he was in Frankfurt or Tokyo or Hong Kong. Before, she had coped with these long separations, partly because there had always been Henry for comfort and companionship, but also because she had been totally confident, wherever he might be, in Edmund 's strength and constancy and love. But now... the doubts and dreadful possibilities of last night 's waking nightmares crowded in on her again. Lottie Carstairs, that madwoman... but perhaps not so mad... telling Virginia things that she had never thought to hear. Edmund and Pandora Blair. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America? He 'll make a fool of you, same as he did his first wife, poor lady. Suddenly, it was all too much. To her horror, she felt her mouth tremble, her eyes prick with tears. Across the table, Conrad watched her, and for a mad instant she thought about confiding in him, spilling out all the anguish of her miserable uncertainties. But then the tears swam into her eyes and his face dissolved into a watery mist, and Virginia thought, oh, bugger, I 'm pissed. Just in time. The moment mercifully was over, and the dangerous temptation behind her. She must never speak about it to anybody, because if she did, then the words, said aloud, might make it all true. Might make it happen. She said, " I 'm sorry. So silly. " She sniffed lustily, searched for a handkerchief, could n't find one. Across the table, Conrad offered his own, white and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blew her nose. She said, " I 'm tired and I 'm miserable. " She tried to make light of it, " I 'm also slightly pissed. " He said, " You ca n't drive yourself home. " " I have to. " " Stay here the night and go back in the morning. We 'll get a room for you. " " I ca n't. " " Why not? " Tears poured again. " I have to get back for the dogs. " He did not laugh at her. He said, " Stay here for a moment. Order coffee. I just have to make a telephone call. " He laid down his napkin, pushed back his chair, and went. Virginia mopped her face, blew her nose again, glanced around the dining-room, anxious that no other person had noticed her sudden attack of weepy emotion. But the other diners were all absorbed in their dinners, munch- p276 ing stolidly at fried fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " trifle. The tears, mercifully, receded. The waitress approached to remove their plates. " Did you enjoy your steak? " " Yes, it was delicious. " " Are you taking sweet? " " No. I do n't think so, thank you. But if we could have some coffee? " She had brought the coffee, and Virginia was already drinking the black and noxious stuff, which tasted as though it had been made out of a bottle, before Conrad returned to her. He drew back his chair and sat down. She looked at him inquiringly, and he said, " That 's all settled. " " What have you settled? " " I 've cancelled my room, and cancelled the hire car for tomorrow. I 'll drive you back to Strathcroy. I 'll drive you home. " " Will you go to Croy? " " No. They 're not expecting me until tomorrow morning. I can go to the pub you mentioned. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't have a room. They 're filled with grouse-shooting visitors who 've taken Archie 's moor. " She sniffed away the last of her weeping, poured his coffee. " You can come to Balnaid. Stay the night there. The guest-room beds are all made up. " She looked up, and caught the expression on his face. She said, " There 's no prob-lem, " but even as she said this, knew that there was. In the darkness, Conrad drove. It had stopped raining, as though the skies had run out of water, but the wind was from the south-west, and still damp, and the night stayed overcast. The road climbed and wound and dipped, and in the hollows lay pools of flood-water from the overflowing ditches. Virginia, bundled in her Barbour, thought of the last time that she had made this journey ; the evening Edmund had met her off the shuttle and they had had dinner together in Edinburgh. Then the sky had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now the darkness was sombre and menacing, and the lights that shone from the windows of farmhouses scattered over the surrounding braes of Strathcroy gave little relief, seeming distant and unreachable as stars. Virginia yawned. " You 're sleepy, " Conrad told her. p277 " Not really. Just too much wine. " She reached out and rolled down the window, and felt the cold, wet, mossy air pour over her face. The tyres of the Subaru hissed on the wet Tarmac ; out of the darkness came the long call of a curlew. She said, " That 's the sound of coming home. " " You certainly live a long way from anywhere, " " We 're just about there. " The street of the village stood empty. Even Mr. Ishak had closed up his shop, and the only lights were those that burnt from behind drawn curtains. On such a night people stayed at home, watched television, made tea. " We turn left, over this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lane beneath the trees, came to the open gates, the drive that led to the house. All was, predictably, in darkness. " Do n't go around to the front, Conrad. Park just here, at the back, I do n't use the front door when I 'm on my own. I 've got the back-door key. He drew up, turned off the engine. While the headlights still burnt, she climbed down and went to unlock the back door, reach inside and switch on a light, The dogs had heard the car and were waiting, and showed gratifying excitement at her return, hurling themselves at her feet and uttering small welcoming noises in the back of their throats. " Oh, what good doggies. " She crouched to fondle them. " I 'm sorry I 've been such a long time. You must have thought I was never coming home. Go on, out you both go and spend pennies, and I 'll give you lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happily out into the darkness, barked at the alien figure alighting from the Subaru, went to smell him, were patted and spoken to, and then, reassured, bounded off into the trees. Virginia went on, switching on more lights. The big kitchen slumbered, the Aga was warm, the refrigerator gently hummed to itself. Conrad joined her, carrying his grip. " Do you want me to put the car away? " " No matter. We 'll leave it in the yard for the night. Just take the keys out... " " I have.... " He laid them on the table. In the uncompromising brightness, they regarded each other, and Virginia found herself overcome, quite suddenly, by a ridiculous shyness. To deal with this, she became businesslike and hostessy. 278 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p278 " Now. You 'd like a drink? A nightcap. Edmund has some malt whisky he keeps for these occasions. " " I 'm okay. " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would. " " I 'll get it. I wo n't be a moment. " When she came back bearing the bottle, he had taken off his coat and hat, and the dogs had returned from their nightly expedition and were already curled up on the beanbags by the Aga. Conrad, hunkered down, was making friends with them, talking softly, smoothing their highdomed well-bred heads with a gentle hand. As Virginia appeared, he stood up. " I 've closed the door, and locked it. " " How kind. Thank you. Actually, we often forget to lock doors. Thieves and robbers do n't seem to be a problem in Strathcroy. " She set the bottle down on the table, found a glass. " You 'd better pour it your-self. " " You 're not joining me? " She shook her head, rueful. " No, Conrad, I 've had enough for this evening. " He poured the malt and filled the tumbler from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. They took them politely, not snapping nor grabbing, and munched them appreciatively up. " They 're beautiful spaniels. " " Edmund 's gun dogs, and very well behaved. With Edmund in charge, they do n't dare be anything else. " The biscuits were finished. She said, " If you 'd like to bring your drink upstairs with you, I 'll show you where you 're sleeping. " She gathered up his hat and coat, and Conrad collected his grip, and she led the way out of the kitchen, turning lights off and on as she went. Down the passage, across the big hall, and up the stairs. " What a lovely house. " " It 's big, but I like it that way. " He followed behind her. Below them, the old grandfather clock ticked the minutes away, but their feet made no sound on the thick carpets. The spare room faced over the front of the house. She opened the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the cold brilliance of the overhead chandelier. It was a large room, furnished with high brass bedsteads and a mahogany suite of Victorian furniture that Virginia had inherited from Vi. Taken unawares, it presented an impersonal face, without flowers or books. As well, the air was stuffy and unused. " I 'm afraid it does n't look very welcoming. " She dropped his hat and p279 coat on a chair and went to fling open the tall sash window. The night wind flowed in, stirring the curtains. Conrad joined her and they leaned out, gazing into the velvety darkness. Light from the window drew a chequered pattern on the gravel beyond the front door, but all else was obscured. He took a deep lungful of air. He said, " It all smells so clean and sweet. Like fresh spring water. " " You have to take my word for it, but we 're looking at a wonderful view. You 'll see it in the morning. Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " From the trees by the church, an owl hooted. Virginia shivered and withdrew from the window. She said, " It 's cold. Shall I close it again? " " No. Leave it. It 's too good to shut away. " She drew the heavy curtains, settling them so that there should be no chinks. " The bathroom 's through that door. " He went to investigate. " There should be towels, and the water 's always hot if you want to take a bath. " She turned on the small lights on the dressing table, and then the bedside light, and then went to switch off the cold brilliance of the chandelier. At once the high-ceilinged room was rendered cosier, even intimate. " I 'm afraid there 's no shower. This is n't a very modern establish-ment. " He emerged from the bathroom as Virginia turned back a heavy bedcover, revealing puffy square pillows encased in embroidered linen, a flowered eiderdown. " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " She folded the cover, laid it aside. " Now. " There was nothing more to occupy her hands, her attention. She faced Conrad. For a moment neither of them spoke. His eyes, behind the heavy horn-rims, were sombre. She saw his rugged features, the deep lines on either side of his mouth. He was still holding his drink in his hand, but now moved to set it down on the table beside the bed. She watched him do this, and thought of that hand gently fondling the head of one of Edmund 's dogs. A kindly man. " Will you be all right, Conrad? " An innocently intended question, but as soon as the words were spoken she heard them as loaded. He said, " I do n't know. " There 's no problem, she had told him, but knew that the problem had lurked between them all evening and now could no longer be pushed out of sight. It was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life was hell.

" " That summer, I fell in love with you.... " " I imagined getting there. In a limousine from Kennedy. And it was all the same. The trees and the lawns, and the smell of the Atlantic blowing in over the Bay. " " You went back to England... " " I wanted someone to tell me I was great. That I was doing all right. I wanted not to be alone. " " I feel like shit... " " It 's two worlds, is n't it, Conrad? Bumping, and then moving apart. Light-years away from each other. "... because I want you. " " Why does everything have to happen when it 's too late? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not impossible. " " It is, because it 's over. Being young is over.

" " That 's what loneliness is all about. " She said, " I know. " Outside in the garden, nothing moved. Nothing stirred the dripping leaves of the rhododendrons. Eventually, a figure slipped away down the narrow paths of the shrubbery, leaving a trail of footmarks on the sodden grass, the indentations of high-heeled shoes. p281 Wednesday the Fourteenth ISOBEL SAT AT HER KITCHEN TABLE, drank coffee and made lists. She was an inveterate list-maker, and these small inventories of things to be done, food to be bought, meals to be cooked, telephone calls to be made, as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dig up the gladioli, were constantly pinned to her kitchen notice-board, along with postcards from friends and children, and the address of a man prepared to clean the outside of the windows. At the moment she was working on three lists. Today, tomorrow, and then Friday. With one thing and another, life had suddenly become very complicated. She wrote : " Dinner Tonight. " There were some chicken joints in the deep-freeze. She could grill these or make some sort of a casserole. She wrote : " Get chicken legs out. Peel potatoes. String beans. " Tomorrow was more complicated, with her house party committed in three different directions. Isobel herself would be at Corriehill for most of the day, helping Verena and her band of ladies to arrange flowers and somehow decorate that enormous marquee. She wrote : " Secateurs. String. Wire. Wire-cutters. Beech-branches. Rowan-branches. Pick all the dahlias. " But, as well, there was Vi 's birthday picnic by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting for Archie, because tomorrow they were driving grouse over Creagan Dubh, which meant that he would be joining the other guns. She wrote : " Baps and cold ham for Archie 's piece. Gingerbread. Apples. Hot soup? " As for Vi 's picnic, Lucilla, Jeff, Pandora, and the Sad American would probably want to go to that, which meant a hefty contribution of goodies from Croy. 282 ROSAMUNDE PILCHER p282 She wrote : " Sausages for Vi 's barbecue. Make some beefburgers. Sliced-tomato salad. French bread. Two bottles wine. Six cans lager. " She poured more coffee, went on to Friday. " Eleven people for din-ner, " she wrote, and then underlined the words and sat debating over grouse or pheasant. Pheasant Theodora was spectacular, cooked with celery and bacon and served with a sauce of egg yolks and cream. As well as being spectacular, Pheasant Theodora could be concocted in advance, which precluded a lot of last-minute labour while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pheasant Theodora. " The door opened and Archie ap-peared. Isobel scarcely raised her head. " You like Pheasant Theodora, do n't you? " " Not for breakfast. " " I did n't mean for breakfast, I meant for dinner the night of the party. " " Why ca n't we have roast grouse? " " Because it 's a fiddle to serve. Little last-minute bits and pieces, like scraps of toast to arrange and gravy to stir. " " Roast pheasant then? " " Same objections. " " Is Pheasant Theodora the one that looks like sick? " " It does, a bit, but I can cook it ahead, " " Why do n't you just cook a head? " " Ha ha. " " What 's for breakfast? " " It 's in the bottom oven. " Archie went over to the Aga and opened the oven door. " A red-letter day! Bacon, sausages, and tomatoes. What 's happened to the porridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Bacon, sausages, and tomatoes are what we always give visitors. " He brought his plate over to the table and settled himself beside her, pouring coffee, reaching for the toast and the butter. " I thought, " he said, " that Agnes Cooper was coming to help on Friday evening. " " So she is. " " Why ca n't she roast the pheasant? " " Because she 's not a cook. She 's a washer-up. " " You could always ask her to cook. " " All right. I will. And we 'll have mince and tattles for dinner because that 's all the poor woman 's capable of. " p283 She wrote. " Clean silver candlesticks. Buy eight pink candles. " " I just wish Pheasant Theodora did n't look like sick. " " If you say it looks like sick in front of all our guests, I shall cut your throat, there and then, with a fruit knife. " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smoked trout? " Archie put half a sausage into his mouth and chewed it thoughtfully. " And pudding? " " Orange sorbet. " " White or red wine? " " A couple of bottles of both, I think. Or champagne. We 'll be drinking champagne for the rest of the evening. Perhaps we 'd better stick to that. " " I have n't got any champagne. " " I shall order a crate today, in Relkirk. " " Are you going to Relkirk? " " Oh, Archie! " Isobel laid down her Biro and gazed at her husband in hopeless exasperation. " Do you never listen to anything I tell you? And why do you think I 'm all dressed up in my posh clothes? Yes, I am going to Relkirk today. With Pandora and Lucilla and Jeff. We 're going shop-ping. " " What are you going to buy?

" " So I 'm not expected to come. " He sounded pleased. He hated shop-ping. " You ca n't come because you 've got to be here when the Sad American arrives. He 's driving a hired car from Relkirk, and he 's due sometime this morning. And you 're not to go wandering off, otherwise he 'll be faced by a deserted house and think he 's not expected and go away again. " " Might be as well. What shall I give him for lunch? " " There 's soup and pate in the larder. " " Which room 's he sleeping in? " " Pandora 's old room. " " What 's his name? " " I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to greet him? Hail, Sad American. " Archie p284 seemed to find this funny. He made his voice enormously deep, " Big Chief Running Nose Speaks with Forked Tongue. " " You 've been watching too much television. " But luckily she found it funny too. " He 'll think he 's come to a madhouse. " " Would n't be all that far off the mark. What time are you setting off for Relkirk? " " About half past ten. " " Lucilla and Jeff seem to be on the move, but you 'd better prize Pandora out of bed or you 'll still be waiting for her at four o'clock in the afternoon. " " I already did, " Isobel told him. " Half an hour ago. " " She 's probably climbed back into bed and gone to sleep again. " But Pandora had not done this thing.

" Good morning, good morning, here I am, and I bet you thought I 'd gone back to bed. " She kissed the top of Archie 's head and settled herself beside him. She was wearing dark-grey flannel trousers and a pale-grey sweater patterned with pink knitted sheep, and was carrying a magazine. This, it appeared, was the root cause of her amusement. " I 'd forgotten this marvellous mag. Papa used to take it every month. The Country Landowner 's Journal. " " We still take it. I never got around to cancelling the subscription. " " I found this copy in my bedroom. It 's simply fascinating, full of mind-boggling articles about something called Flea-Beetle Dust, and how we 've all got to be terribly kind to badgers. " She began to riffle through the pages. Isobel poured her a cup of coffee. " Oh, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ads at the back. Do listen to this one : For Sale, Titled Lady Wishes to Dispose of Underclothes. Peach-Pink Directoire Knickers and Silk Opera-Top Vests. Hardly Worn. Offers.
