1011241 A DIY JDM-tuned Subaru WRX Headnote RARE IS GOOD, BUT EXPENSIVE IS BETTER <p> TOMMY SHEK IS LATE. AS THE OWNER of a highly tuned 300-hp Subaru WRX-one that should be good for high-1 2s in the quarter-mile-Shek should n't be late for anything. After all, we made it here on time from New York 's Upper West Side. That is several miles on the subway, across Manhattan and into Queens. And then all the way to the last stop on the purple-colored 7 line : Main Street, Flushing. Queens, along with the Bronx and parts of Long Island, is where much of the sport compact tuning around New York City takes place. Less than five minutes away, under the shadow of Shea Stadium, is the Iron Triangle, a 13-block district of car parts and repair shops. A few blocks in the opposite direction is Francis Lewis Boulevard, infamous for its street races. Shek 's yellow WRX eventually rumbles to an open spot across the street. " Cops stopped me, " he says when I settle myself into shotgun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a detective. I saw him in my rearview. he was following me for a couple of blocks. " This kind of shakedown happens a lot in Flushing, and it is nothing new for Shek, a business major at Stonybrook College on Long Island. Although he keeps his fixed-up WRX low-key-no loud graphics or wing-it still has an IHI VF34 turbo upgrade( installed by Metric Subaru Performance Tuningmspt.net) and enough power parts to make the seat rumble beneath my bottom. JDM tuning is generally known as the expensive practice of using only Japanesebrand parts. The letters stand for " Japanese domestic manufacturer, " and the Cliffs Notes version goes like this : A rare part is good, but an expensive one is better. " I learned about USDM and JDM parts through Option magazine, " Shek says, referring to the Japanese media monster that is an underground hit in America. Shortly after receiving the WRX for his birthday, Shek made a trip to Japan. " I bought all these videos and learned the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ videos. I looked up stores that advertised in Option and showed them to taxi drivers. And then they would drive me to the shops. I wound up sending lots of parts back from Japan, because it 's cheaper than buying them in America. " Although Shek 's car does n't look nearly as extreme as those found in the plot-deficient Hollywood movies-another aspect of JDM tuning, believe it or not, is subtletyit 's got it where it counts. The suspension is complete Cusco. The wheels are Volk Racing CE28Ns. The interior has been completely reupholstered in Bride material. The body kit is either C-West or custom carbon fiber, like the side skirts( JDM parts can be ordered at fizzautosports.com). And, well, we 've already tackled the engine, which continues to be the topic of our conversation. " I ca n't remember how many tickets I 've gotten, " Shek says. " A cop once made me get out of the car and gave me four tickets. One for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visible from the dash- " one for my exhaust, one for being too loud, one for disrupting the police. " I tell him they all sound like the same ticket( no pun intended). Shek agrees, " Yeah, they 're all the same. " " Are n't you scared of driving now? " I ask. " It 's a paranoia feeling, " he says, " but now I 'm used to it. I drive extra slow these days. " he smiles. " But sometimes I like to have fun. " Which is precisely what Shek does when we hit an open stretch on Francis Lewis. A few years ago, the police put an end to the racing by flooding the street. " They would open that hydrant over there, " Shek says, pointing, " and let it run for two hours. No one would be able to get any traction. " These days, Shek has moved on from the street. he began entering car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward winning show trophies. As for the power, he is happy with 300 hp. It is streetable. " Besides, " he says, " there 's nowhere in New York that you can really go all-out anyway. "
