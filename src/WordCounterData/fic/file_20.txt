1003141 The following is from Vrouwelijk enkelvoud( Antwerp/Amsterdam : Manteau, 1987). <p> THE WHITE BLOUSE Sylvia has to wear to work in the restaurant is soiled at the end of the day with soup, with cocoa, with chocolate, with cream. It 's hanging over a chair. The sweat has seeped into the lace collar. <p> She keeps dreaming she wakes up and has to go to work. So she keeps trotting through the restaurant with her tray, even when she 's asleep, squeezes herself between customers, moves back and forth from the tables to the kitchen : one order on top of the other. She can not switch off the movement. When she wakes up, she hears herself screaming above the restaurant 's numbing hum. Even though she wrote everything down, there is always a new order she ca n't remember. <p> That is the way she sleeps. The blouse is a white blot in the room. The alarm clock is set half an hour early. When it rings she jumps up, pushes the button down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the dream again, piling everything up in the five minutes between alarms. That is the way she wakes up every morning, the way she works every day, the way she sleeps every night. She thinks : there will be a time when I wo n't get up. Here, or somewhere else, outside, I do n't know where. <p> " They still have n't found that woman that worked in the kitchen with us, you know. " <p> " What happened? " <p> " What do you mean what happened? Her husband came over here. When his wife still was n't home at night. But we were all closed up here. At night. Of course we 're all closed up here. I do n't know what he did then. That I do n't know. She just did n't come home. And then the next morning. That was a sight for sore eyes, that was. They broke open her locker to look. We all have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they should n't break it open, they should n't. It 's like your personal locker, you know? And then they waited for her husband in the morning. And that 's when all tongues start wagging, of course. But he had to go to work. What do you expect, it was morning. But her husband was allowed to come then, anyway. He must have got time off at work. Together with the director. The director must have asked if he could get time off, I guess. They were all standing here, in the hallway that leads to the kitchen. And then they broke open her locker. But they did n't find anything. They thought maybe a letter or something. But they did n't find anything. Just her things and stuff. For work. You have to have at least two members of staff present, you know, and one of the bosses, before they can break open your locker. And they poked around in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to myself : maybe she 's dead by now and they 're poking around in her things, just like that. I could n't stay there. I said to myself : this is not going to work. I did n't stay there. I could n't. <p> " And now they 're still looking for her. The police say it only floats to the surface on the fourth day. It always does. Four days, they say. They all float to the surface after four days. If she drowned herself, that is. But they did n't tell her husband that, of course they would n't. Imagine. The director, yes. But he did n't say anything about it either. Probably not allowed to, I guess. Because of the children. " <p> " What? " <p> " That 's what I was going to say, maybe because of the children. " <p> " That must be bad. " <p> " That 's the worst, I guess. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go and do a thing like that. Her, that 's her business, but those children. I 've been thinking about them a lot. " <p> " And him? Does he have to go to work? " <p> " Well of course, what do you think? Of course he has to go to work. I do n't know how he does it either. When he has to go to work. I keep thinking what does he do when he comes home at night -- "( Cries). <p> In the morning Sylvia eats only a little mandarin orange. She picks up her bag that is standing on the table and checks to see that the cigarettes, the lighter, the handkerchiefs, and the purse are inside. At the front door she drops in the keys. She maneuvers her bicycle out of the hallway, weaving between two trash cans. Then she pulls the door closed. <p> She took five orders. When she got with her tray to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two children, she repeated their order one more time while she served them, as if to make sure she was doing it right. But the woman said, in very cultured Dutch : " Will you please tell me your name, Miss? " Sylvia pointed to the name tag she has to wear and asked : " Why? " She thought maybe there was something wrong with the order. The children looked at her, amazed and indignant. No waitress had ever been that cheeky with them before. You often get people who are not happy with the staff in department stores, they just think it 's not my business anyway, so why should I- <p> Once Sylvia crushed a glass in her fist out of sheer anger. She could feel it breaking even though she did not want it to. The pieces fell into a bucket of cut onions. The guys in the kitchen had to start all over again : peeling anions and cutting them up. Her fingers were bleeding something fierce. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, really. The pieces of glass had made little tears in her fingertips. <p> On her second day in the restaurant she had to wait on four Germans. She tried to explain to them what was on the menu. They were amused by her explanation. Each of the four wanted something different. The tray was too small for her to bring the whole order to their table in one trip. When she finally arrived with four portions of French fries, she noticed the headwaiter got there first. The Germans were laughing even louder. When the cook noticed she had come back to the kitchen, crying, he said : " You 'll have to get used to it here. " <p> In the dressing room the waitresses notice she wears only a skirt, nylon stockings, and a blouse to work. Before she goes home, she puts on trousers and a sweater and leaves her hair hanging loose on her shoulders. <p> " Sylvia. when are you finally going to become a real lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to become a real lady? " When she smiles without answering they say : " You 'd better get your hair done. At the hairdresser 's. " <p> She has been waitressing the whole afternoon in the department store restaurant. It is so busy people were spilling out into the store. The staff is supposed to work in shifts, but they are often asked to work till evening anyway. They get their overtime paid under the table. <p> She stands still, she hears all the voices in the hum, separately and together. Then she faints. <p> Where Sylvia lives the houses are built in rows. Rows of identical constructions regulating what people think, how they talk, whom they accept, whom they reject. Some have been made a bit more comfortable with time. But not the house where Sylvia rents a room with a kitchen on the first floor. Paint has been spilled on the floor of the hallway, but nothing else has been painted. When she comes home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner already told her it makes scratches on the walls. He came to fix a few door frames. There is a draft between the woodwork and the walls. The window in the kitchen is torn. She told him. But he ca n't fix it all. He already fixed the toilet. There is a room on the second floor that still has n't been rented. " I have to pay for that one too, " he said. He 'll wait until the rent brings in the money to fix the rest. He 's not going to spend good money on such a run-down, damp old workers ' house. It has always been occupied by old people. They do n't fix up houses like that much. <p> Tonight she sits by the stove with a book. They told her at work she should take it easy. For her nerves. So it will be better tomorrow. Does she go out a lot at night? <p> They told Sylvia she fainted. " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table 26, then she walked into the kitchen and fainted, " she heard the head of restaurant personnel tell the secretary of general personnel. The way the woman was talking about Sylvia you would have thought she did n't even know her. <p> And as if Sylvia had n't understood a word of that conversation, the head of personnel told her she suddenly collapsed. Like that : keeled over. On the kitchen floor. For no obvious reason. " Just so, " said the head of personnel, who put the report in front of her, " the department store is covered where its employees are concerned. A matter of mutual trust, but also -- obviously -- a precondition for further employment. " They do n't know whether she hit anything. Probably not, what do you think? You would have felt a pain in your back by now or something... She had to sign a statement that she did not feel any pain anywhere. Later the waitresses told her again what happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen, too, your falling. What if it had happened in the actual restaurant? " <p> They carried her to the fourth floor. The cook 's assistant gave them a hand. They put her in an easy chair in reception. They told the personnel employees what happened. They said they would get a nurse, that Sylvia would come to any minute now. And that they could n't stay with her, that they 'd better get back to work, there was nothing for them to do there anyway. But the cook 's assistant then said : " Is there a nurse here? First I heard of it. " They repeated they were going to get a nurse and that he should get back to work, and the waitresses too : thank you very much but you 're not needed here anymore. The waitresses went back to the restaurant, but the cook 's assistant stayed with her. Nobody said anything else. Sylvia came to after ten minutes. The cook 's assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't do a thing. They kept running up and down, all nerves, asking themselves what documents they had to draw up. What forms had to be filled out by the temp? Sylvia drank the water down, but brought it up again immediately. She was ashamed, but the cook 's assistant said : " Do n't mention it. Do n't worry. I 'll clean it up. " Then she heard the secretary of personnel tell her the episode had caused a lot of administrative work and that she had given everybody a fright. To the cook 's assistant she said : " You ca n't tell me you bring up normal pure water again. That 's impossible. " And she gave him such a piercing stare he did n't know what to do anymore. <p> There is a big garage on the ground floor, just under her room. Sylvia complained to the owner about the noise. But he replied the garage he rents out brings in a lot more money than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate slide open at night. Like the bow of a ferryboat opening. Then she hears a car drive in. The headlights send their light across the ceiling. Then the gate slides slowly shut and the lock clicks. When she 's lying awake she also hears the pump : it starts up at regular intervals, pumping the water that heats the garage. <p> She has been lying there, thinking about the cook 's assistant. Staying with her like that. He never said a single word to her before. <p> The head of personnel asked Sylvia why she fainted. She did n't remember, she did n't even know anymore that she wrote down a vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce first. He showed her the slip of paper. It was her handwriting. <p> " You see, we keep everything. " <p> " I do n't know how it happened. It was all of a sudden. " <p> The head had checked all the information she had to fill out on the forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe there was an illness she had forgotten to mention when she applied for this job. Sylvia did n't dare to say the restaurant makes her ill. She thought of the terrible hum of the voices in her head. The head of personnel kept staring at her. <p> " I have never been ill before. " <p> He did n't know what to write down. <p> " It 's the first time I fainted like that. " <p> " All the more reason : personnel will see to it that your medical statement is verified by the firm 's doctor. There must be something wrong somewhere, people do n't faint just like that. Especially not if they have never been ill before. " <p> Sylvia was forced to sign yet another form. The third one. She was no longer interested in whatever it was they still wanted written down. Let them write what they want. Let them draw up what forms they want in triplicate. <p> " It 's in your own best interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he noticed the disinterested attitude of the person in question. He knows what is in her best interest, and a good thing too. The final form had also been prepared in triplicate. Her writing gets sloppy when she has to write her name so many times in a row. She handed him the statement. <p> " You 're not pregnant, are you? " <p> No, she 's not pregnant. <p> " Are you on the pill then? " <p> The bass sounds of the music from the disco, a few houses down, can be heard until early in the morning. The electric garage gate has slid open three times already. It 's a quarter to four. Three more hours of sleep. <p> Sylvia has become very nervous. She has been tossing and turning in bed. She tried to smoke a cigarette. She was scared awake by the alarm before it began to ring. She lay there, counting five minutes a couple of times before she got up. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She asked herself how much longer she will be working in the department store. It reminds her of the first days. While she was cleaning a coffee machine she pulled a rod out of its base and suddenly hot chocolate sauce was running all over the floor. How was she to know they had stored chocolate sauce in the coffee machine? The cook just told her : " Do n't forget to clean the coffee machine. " That 's how you started work in a restaurant. <p> She went to see Erna last night. Erna is pregnant. They went to eat together in the Passando. Erna was wearing a blue coat. <p> " I 've had it for ages, " she said. <p> After a while Erna began to talk about her husband. She looks tired when she talks about him. Her face looks swollen. <p> " I 'm drinking again, " she said. He sometimes beats her until she goes completely numb. Until she feels like she does n't exist anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that, " she said. Her skin has become very hard. Her hands are full of scratches. She said he sometimes takes her arm and puts his cigarette out on it. The burn wounds have left deep brown scars. She rolled up her sleeves. There are n't many people around anyway. <p> Mary has come to eat a pancake with butter and sugar in the Passando. She put on her pearl gray sweater for it. She spent more than two hours in front of the mirror with her makeup. She eats the pancake with a knife and fork. Just like at home on her birthday, when she 's allowed to ask Sophie and Isabelle from her class over to her house. The pancake has been rolled up to perfection. How on earth do they manage it? There is warm brown sugar inside. When she cuts off little bits the butter drips over the edge. Her parents will be in soon. That means she has a cappucino 40 still to look forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Did you like it? " That way Mary learns to go to the Passando alone, little by little. Her father is wearing a water-blue scarf with cashmere designs in his open shirt. He always dresses a bit casual. <p> " And you should see my legs, " said Erna, " you can still see where he kicked me. I 'm getting such hard knots there. " No matter what she says to him, he beats her anyway. <p> " I never thought it would be like this when I got married. " He sometimes takes her to the bars with him. She has to go along. Even if she wants to stay home. Then he gets drunk. When she says something he beats her. <p> " With other people around. It 's so humiliating. " <p> " And do n't the others do anything? " <p> " No. They say : to each his own. " <p> " I do n't get that. " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs either. " <p> But ca n't she fight back then? She is much stronger than he is, but she ca n't fight back. <p> " I just ca n't do it. " It always reminds her of her mother. She does n't know why, either. And of the children. <p> " I just ca n't seem to defend myself. " The children always begin to scream and cry, but he hits her in the face anyway, whether they 're there or not. <p> " I do n't know how he lives with himself. " And when she holds up a hand before her face he wrenches her fingers back and puts out his cigarette on her arm. He only lets go when she screams. <p> " But there are times when I ca n't scream anymore, " she said. " It 's as if my throat is squeezed shut up here. " <p> " Why do you want to stay with a guy like that? " <p> " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't understand. " <p> In the morning he sometimes sits and whimpers about what he did. " Did I do that? " It 's not that she never gave him hell for it. She must have shown him her arms a hundred times, or her legs after he kicked her. <p> " Look what you did, " she says when he 's sitting at the table in the morning. <p> But it does n't help. <p> " That 's all he ever got to see at home, too. His father used to beat his mother. It 's not his fault. He always does it again. When he 's had something to drink --. " Once he locked her in. When she wanted to leave he had locked all the doors. " You have to stay here, " he said, " and look after your children. " She said she would just go and sit in the little yard behind the house then, with the turtles. She had two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go sit with the turtles. " She sat there for hours, crying. When the children came back from school they were not even allowed to go to her. Now and then he went and stood at the kitchen window while she was sitting there. He did n't say a word. Then he came out and gouged out the turtles ' eyes while she had to sit and watch. They died that night. <p> Erna kept telling those stories all night. He does n't beat her anymore now that she 's pregnant, she said. The doctor read him the riot act. If he ever does it again she 's going to stay with her mother until the baby is born. Her mother said she should come and live with her then, until the baby was born. <p> From now on Sylvia is only allowed to wash the dishes in the department store. The head of personnel says it 's a special favor. Because she fainted. They do n't want it to happen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commiserate. " Do n't let it get to you, Sylvia. It may be only temporary. " Later that afternoon she said more bluntly what she thought. " It 's not that difficult to do the head a little favor. You know how he is. It 's all he ever thinks about. Men. But he 's very considerate. " Sylvia washes dishes now, day in, day out, cleans the coffee machine, keeps the drainage pipes unclogged, and sorts the leftovers in iron vats. <p> " They come to get that stuff with a truck. " <p> Before going home she stops in at The Anchor to drink something. But here, too, she can hardly stand the numbing bustle. She goes and buys a new purse and returns to her room in the other part of town. It has begun to rain. <p> She has trouble opening the front door. A sheaf of junk mail sits wedged under it. Every Tuesday. <p> When she walks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes and washes her hands under the faucet in the hallway. The water is cold. When she comes back she first lights the gas stove. She leaves the curtains closed. She switches on the bluish night-light and sits down on the bed. She rubs her fingers along the soft leather of the new purse. Her hands are rough from the chemical detergents she uses for washing dishes. There is a little salve left in the kitchen. She rolls up the sleeves of her sweater. This morning she burned herself on one of the empty pans that had only just got back from the stove. It 's her own fault. It would n't happen if she stayed away from pans that are not brought to her. Let her stay with her dishes. What possesses her to come and get pans that have n't cooled off yet anyway? So now she burned herself. She did not dare to breathe a word about it to anyone. She thought it had stopped hurting after a while. She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blister after all. She does n't know how to treat those. She is afraid dirt will get into the wound. The salve smells funny. She dares not use it. <p> When she closes her eyes the confusion begins again. The hum of the clients, the clatter of eating utensils beats through her brain. She feels faint again. Maybe the cold will help. She stays in the kitchen, sitting on a chair. The window looks out on a blank wall that protects a garden gone wild. She hates this view. She thinks of the work of the people who made the objects in the kitchen. After a while she begins to cry. She feels herself getting closer and closer to the objects. But it will pass. It will pass, she thinks, it will. She feels tired. I only get paid to wash those dishes. I just sell myself. And what do I have left? <p> She sits down on the bed again, next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will fall away from me. But the tension does not fall away from her. The surface of her body is forever in motion. The upper layers of her skin contract incessantly. Maybe that 's why I ca n't sleep, she thinks. Or is it because I almost do n't eat anymore? That 's because I have to sort the leftovers in those stinking vats. Just the smell of food --. Ever since she started working in the kitchen she only drinks coffee. And she eats a mandarin orange before she leaves in the morning. <p> Pol Hoste( born 1947) made a notable debut with De veranderingen( The Changes, 1979), an illuminating attack on impotence and the fear that nothing can ever again be changed. The novel alludes to the students ' revolt of May 1968 in Paris and the Ghent dock strike of 1972. But after the intoxication of revolution comes, inevitably, the hangover. The intellectuals who seek to " liberate " the masses do not get through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masses do not want change : they want bread and circuses, porn, TV, football, and beer. In his novel Vrouwelijk enkelvoud( Feminine Singular, 1987) Hoste focuses on the fate of exploited women and their state of dependence. <p>
