1008041 Every Sunday afternoon, my family heads to my Aunt Pat 's house for dinner. Aunt Pat always makes a huge meal and my parents always bring the dessert. <p> This week, my mom brought doughnuts covered in powdered sugar. During the car ride, my brother Derek and I opened the box and stared at them as our mouths watered. <p> When we finally got to my aunt 's house, I dashed inside to give her a hug. But she looked upset. <p> " I 'm sorry, guys, " Aunt Pat said as we filed in the doorway. " The oven broke and the repairman was only able to fix it now. Dinner is going to be an hour late. " <p> An hour late? My stomach was grumbling already! <p> Mom must have read my mind( or heard my stomach growl) because she said, " No doughnuts until after dinner! I do n't care how late it is. " <p> After Aunt Pat got the vegetarian lasagna in the oven, the adults went to wait in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just in time to see Derek grab a doughnut from the box and scarf it down. As he licked the powdered sugar off his lips, I let out a shout of surprise. <p> Mom hurried into the room to see what the commotion was. Her eyes darted to the open doughnut box and then to the messy floor. <p> Derek pointed at me and said, " He was eating a doughnut! I tried to stop him, and he shouted! " <p> " What a liar. It was n't me! " I pleaded. " Derek took the doughnut, Mom! " <p> " I did n't do it. I swear, " Derek said, and he held up his right hand as if he were on trial. <p> Mom took one look at Derek and said, " There will be no doughnuts for you after dinner. You 've already had enough! " <p> How did Mom know it was Derek who ate the doughnuts <p> Need a clue? There 's one @ @ @ @ @ @ @
