5002841 # 17-YEAR CICADAS, KNOWN AS " NYMPHS, " LIVE UNDERGROUND, ONLY TO COME OUT EVERY 17 YEARS. THE INSECT EMERGES AT SUNSET, AFTER WHICH THE SINGING BEGINS. # In the red and graven leaves of autumn they came out. The twentieth year. Not one of them had watches, the telling of time. Yet they knew. They came up the long columns of earth, pushing it ahead of them, and when they broke ground each of the dirt places was a mound, as if a mine had been shafted and drawn from. They had dirt in their eyes, the first blue and green shades that caught the fragile light and made of it a thinking cavity ; finding the recess where all this thought lay, thoughts of camp, of weenie bakes and games and running through the tall grass that had passed, that had now yellowed and on certain days dampened with the first inclination of cold rains making the ground sodden and repulsive. # They came up out of the field, as it tangled in pumpkins without faces yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skitter of insects breathing and larking. Insects do n't breathe. They inhale, with the tin of a cheap flute, cartilaginous, with a crust. They are ample to the task, and so these camp members. They had uniformly one allegiance : all of a thought. # It was deliberate in the intention. The ground, otherwise like all ground, had been chosen. It was exemplary. They well knew where they were. And it required no leaders. Not one. All led. All followed. # They found the stream, cold, chilled to a kind of warmth, scalding with its cessation of movement -- what a gasp it would bring -- and stripped off their camp clothing, their insignias denoting this and that, and naked as prey, they washed, immersing themselves for their blessing, and there was a dove or two that circled in wonder, looking for worms or anything given. They were far too animate to be victims. They had smiles on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, fell from them, and they began to shout, not names, merely phrases, and the phrases echoed against the far hills and steeper inclines of rock and stone touched by the roots of trees that would, under no circumstances, give up their green. There was early snow in these high passes none of them would touch. So much in this short moment was there only to be looked at, gazed at, and remarked. They blinked their eyes. # The males and females sorted themselves in their brazen nakedness into distinct groups. Everything was already known. It had taken these twenty cycles of changes that never relented for the thought to occur, and it had occurred to them all at once. Suddenly the earth that wove back on itself, turning, was alive with their yawns and renewing dexterities. The writhing of a hand, the testing of a thumb, the flexing of the eyelids, against minerals. Some of them cried, but not many. They did not seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if by a watchful hand that did n't otherwise intervene, that had appointed the scene for what it would be. Not a log rolling contest or carrying another on one 's back, or the eating of pie, until the mouth overflowed the smile in otherwise solitary eyes. # It was n't that kind of camp. No, you see. It was special. You might even call it destiny. Destiny is when things happen. And then you make the effort to explain them. You tote things up, like hamburger patties, matching mouth for burger. Counting the raffle tickets, the napkins, the plastic forks, mounting the tables, tying down the many tents. Yet this beckons the question and does not answer it. # The sun rose. They had awakened themselves in the first and initial kindling of light. Its fingers, insensate and dumb, had quickened and reached, even into the rust-colored sparks of the soil, woven with blind worms and squirming beetles with their lovely shells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hunger they clawed the ground into submission, carrying it and discarding it. Not one of them had a tan. Milk white flesh, almost blue, lacking the elemental touch of radiance that brings color and all like things. # The sun now was high in the sky. Their feet crackled over the leaves. The males met the females with their own glances. The two troops of these scouts, male and female, began to move slowly, shyly together. There were smiles. Glances. Precious little mind-boggling glances. # The light was so very beautiful. It was breaking up, on leaves and within the pearls of frosted water that glided, rested in the nooks that caught the world, the huge world -- the basic signs, neither mother nor father, but something more deeply, convincingly magnetic, north to south, west to east, all the imagined directions. # They looked at one another. There was a teeming of sexes. The two groups broke up and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground about, and they mutually haunted each other with their incisive looks. # Every detail mattered. Nothing escaped this intense scrutiny. There was howling and shrieks and dances, in a circle of moving hands and feet, the flexing of the ankles as they bowed, kneeled and prostrated themselves. The wolves in the higher mountain grass also circled and howled and the squirrels dug in and waited and left the acorns at peace, and it began. # The males and females, all scoutmasters of their own merits, began to close magnetically into pairs of two. There was wind, and the shreds of clouds and cloud banks leavened themselves of mist and pattering rain, and there was a crackle of thunder and that thunder intensified at the eyes turned up toward their very lids and the frenzy of coupling movement and raving limbs that made nevertheless concentric circles, pulling at the opposite flesh as if to disgorge it from its seat in bone. There were cries here and there, and then the couples hushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the heavens, which were all now heaped -- a convulsive, enigmatic heap, through which the light poured in shafts until all these camp goers were silent and merely breathing, satisfaction written on their now childlike faces, a manner of peace, of fulfillment. A vacuity. They rolled away from each other even further and gazed at each other and blew kisses from both sides of the divide. And then the divide was thorough again. # The rain was golden, aloof with this shafted light, and it sprinkled all their faces and wetted their skin but did not make them cold. It was ice on them, but it was not cold. They began to laugh. They fell silent, then. They gazed in another rapture. # Then they began to go, hand in hand, and deposit their eggs. Their eggs were red and purple and turquoise and they settled them on the branches and under the logs and in the high grass where there was something, a dark rock or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deceptive pock of nothing perhaps. An insinuation. # The eggs spawned in air, the wet, humid, fibrous air, and grasping angels formed from them. These angels circled under the clouds and hovered and manifested their smiles, which were deeply wicked and still angelical, alive with pride and chock full of cunning, disregard, a willingness to malign and hold dear, celebrate and demean, all potencies of the plain. # The plain stretched away in a gullible configuration of meaningless, bleeding rain. The clouds darkened. All participants looked up. They staggered a little. Their skin seemed to come off in husks. There would be no apple-bobbing contest. No wheelbarrow races. And no one would run home crying. # Their skins began to peel. They sat or fell in the wet, wet grass. They began to wheeze and aspirate. They did not look at each other. They essentially ignored each other. Some slept, and, as they did, squirrels, fresh from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the dark, green grass, began to sup on them, eating their substance away. # And, one by one, the participants died, shrank, the wind from the many passes blew them apart, scattering their articles, everything that had been so grand. The jaw bones shrank, the cups of the skulls fragmented, an odor came up, and, one by one, they began to settle down through the grass. # The rainwater carried them. The angels, never in mourning but in exultation, became moths, and circled and careened and then formed into a mass and moved south, toward the sweet, diamond-like regions well beyond memory or caring. The mass of them circled only once as a single entity. Then they were gone. The sun came out of the clouds. Camp was over. # Seventeen years would pass over this deep negligence. The moths, in their salmon-like fury, strode the mountains, never touching the crests. # What was left remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and deftly remaindered for the next season, the renewed carnival, the tryst, a shrine of execration, a filthy bog, an envelope of untold mastery. # The weather continued, infinitely unpredictable. No one knew whether the next day would be good
