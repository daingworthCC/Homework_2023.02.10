1001941 A Leap of Faith. <p> Dora tugged at the bedspread. Why could she never make it touch the floor on both sides? Her sisters did n't care anyway, she thought, as she picked up Iris and Delilha by their heads and set them back against the pillow. There, she whispered. Peggy, her stupid room-mate, was sound asleep. " Do dress your dolls. ' She never answered anything about naked dolls, and when they gave her stupid doll clothes for Iris and Delilha she threw them out the window. First feeling the large callous that was slowly eating up her foot, she then sprinkled powder into her sneakers and slipped them on, pressing closed the velcro straps. Zip, rip, crackle. She made it work over and over again. Her knees were whole ever since she did n't have shoe laces tripping her : bad bows, not her fault. She remembered suddenly that last night she 'd dreamed of roses. Peg had received them for her pneumonia and until Dora smelled the awful sweetness in her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was what she 'd wanted to name one of her sisters. Iris would have been Rose. But the names had been up to Dora 's mother. Dora was n't allowed to have children and so she had made Iris and Delilha her sisters. Everything had to be realistic. <p> She kissed Peg on the forehead because she did n't want her to die. Still, for being such a tattle-tale she deserved a punishment so before Dora left the room, she pulled the petals off Peg 's roses. She stared at them and not knowing what to do sat back down on her own bed and cried. Once she 'd eaten a raw egg because someone forced and she told that it was like eating a bad sneeze which had gotten laughs from her father a long time ago. Poor Peg was moaning. Stop blubbering. Crying, I 'm crying ca n't you see. Dora hated the word blubbering because she thought staff members used it to sat there was no reason to cry when there always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattered the petals onto Peg 's bible beside the vase where just the stems still stood in water so that Peg would think they 'd fallen off by themselves and then quietly turned off the light and closed the door behind her. She smelled pancakes because it was Friday. The white ceiling in the stairwell closed around her and the idea of mother coming today. Mother coming, better than pancakes. <p> Dora looked down her red plate. Danny on her right had a blue plate and Bitsy, of course, tiny Bitsy way down at the end had green. The color of the plate told Sampson, the big woman in the white coat who served the food from a trolley, what size portion to put down. Dora knew it was somebody 's idea to make them all think they were on a special diet, not just the FATSOS, the TUB OF LARDS. She was born hating to be called names - RETARD a long time ago - and now especially Door for short. Her stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter what the answer would be no and it was better to be friends with Sampson. She stuck her finger in her coffee to make sure it was hot enough for her rubber mouth. They called her " as-pest-os " - she could never say the word - " mouth. " She slipped her arm around Sampson 's waist. When Dora saw the older woman wiggle, she let her go out of respect and them Sampson patted Dora 's hand. It gave her goose bumps to be in good with staff. <p> " It 's too muddy, " Dora complained. She did n't like Dave to lead activity. She wanted Frank because he kidded better. Dave tried to make them sing songs at the same time as they walked around the pond. Frank let her sit down when she was tired, but not stupid Dave who told stories about Jesus Christ and his bleeding feet - " for you and you and you he died " - so today she faked a stone in her shoe. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she knew what they did to lepers. There were ducks in the pond and she watched one waddle up onto the bank. Soft feathers on her lap. Did real people know how to make a duck cuddle? Dora 's own mother okayed one big hug at the beginning. You 're too old to cry and she would leave early. Pulling eggs down her throat. Today, Mother my friend. <p> A big machine that had a mind of its own with one long arm had spooned out the dirt to make the pond Dora remembered a long time ago and still stood in her way. The big men with stomachs like Dora 's who sat up high in the machine and sometimes ate lunch in the restaurant where Dora waitressed were sour pusses, paying no attention to Dora no even to kid a little, pools of ketchup always left on their plates. Tomorrow at the hospital Dora was to be spooned out inside so she would n't bleed anymore. Her mother said she 'd eaten peanuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dora herself had signed her whole name on a piece of paper. It had been up to her. <p> Baby pine trees had just been planted along one bank and other segments around the pond were roped off so you would n't accidentally walk over seeds trying to grow. Dora took a stick of sugarless gum from her pocket. Chewing, she looked beyond the duck playground, her playground too, and saw the bridge which connected the highway to the toll road that by-passed the city of Chicago. Sometimes groups including Dora went on the other road in a bus to the Museum of Science and Industry, never to Disneyland. Dora was always dimly aware of the sound of big trucks and buses and cars speeding by. <p> By 11:00 Dora was filling mustard bowls in the restaurant. A man came in before the restaurant officially opened for lunch and it was Dora 's idea that he be served anyway. Dora 's supervisor whom Dora had once heard someone compare to a chicken wing - for her toughness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a pad and sent her out like having a small part in the Christmas pageant. Why did they never think she-Dora-could do anything? <p> The stranger was big like some of the workmen and he wanted salad bar so Dora went with him while he filed his plate and explained what all the things were. Then she brought him coke. Out the bay window where he sat in the curved booth she saw his huge truck where there was no parking allowed. <p> One bean at a time, she saw him eat, and knew she could beat him at cards. The last three times she 'd gone out on her mother. Staff members like to play cards with her too and Dora 's mother said that somehow cards made Dora 's brain work. <p> " I heard the pies were good here. " <p> She did n't say : if she could n't eat pie he should n't either. " Why do n't you blink right, " she did ask, watching him put effort into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. He did n't care her mother had n't come. <p> Dora sort of knew Brenda was beside the kitchen door trying to get Dora 's attention, always trying to boss Dora around so Dora ignored her until Brenda came over and pulled her by the arm. " OK, OK, " Dora said, bossing back in her way. By the time Dora returned to watch the man again, he had already paid the cashier and gone. The shadow of his truck still loomed through the window. It was his coat she knew still hanging on a peg by the door. She found a pack of candy corn in the pocket and then hurried out to find him. <p> By then he was walking out the main road toward the toll-road bridge. Hiding under his hat, roped off ; no hair. Dora felt her own thick hair, nice, except she still begged for permanents to curly it, more people would try to touch her head like her father had when he was alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago. Standing on the walkaway Dora heard Brenda 's footsteps inside trying to find Dora. The man had reached the bridge and she watched him climb the stairs that ran up both sides allowing, Dora supposed, people to cross the big road. She 'd never seen anyone go up before. Do n't Brenda, that hurts. <p> Dora let the phone in her mother 's house ring 22 times. Then she ate lunch in the kitchen off a plain white plate. She remembered who the man reminded her of. It was the man who made her bleed. When Dora was a girl she 'd wandered off behind her house to where the railroad crossed a field and though she knew not to go on the tracks themselves - too scary anyway - when a man who was hidden back there like a spider she 'd stared at in a gas station bathroom one day asked her to come sit on his knee, she moved forward. Playing a game for a minute she ran away laughing. Tag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't read or write. Without her underpants, young to have a beard down there, he said. No boils then. The next day she began to bleed and even though her mother told her that all women bleed, Dora knew it was because he had touched her there. <p> Sirens sounded down the road and just seemed to Dora that something was going on. Like a long time ago when she was a girl, she 'd been left alone in the family house and found out her father had died of a heart attack on the tennis court where he had been winning 5-0 against a younger man. At the funeral everybody talked all the details and she taught people how he had touched her - Dora - on the head. Nobody did it right. They brought him home wearing white and then suddenly changed him, black. Every weekend a long time ago her father took her with him to the hardware store where she got bored but always wanted to go again next time. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Dora screamed to her mother that she wished it had been her mother who died instead of him and her mother looked surprised and Dora knew that it was all more mixed up. Because she had n't meant that, only that his legs had been so beautiful sticking out of white shoes. No, that her mother should n't yell at her. She 'd tried to flush the kit-kat wrapper down the toilet, but it would n't go and Dora hated to be caught being too fat. It was on that day before she 'd agreed to her mother to have the operation. <p> Dora let the phone in her mother 's house ring 50 times. Even Brenda felt sorry for her. Then Dora went out to see about the sirens. She saw policemen crawling inside the man 's truck. Traffic stopped all along the road as far as she could see. There was a flashing light down under the bridge where the man had gone and done something wrong. Dora suddenly saw herself wearing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was her on her dresser inside a silver frame. Maybe her mother had gotten stuck in one of the honking cars. <p> Dora dropped the man 's coat when she figured out he had jumped a long way to be dead. <p> " He ate three pieces of pie, " she told the policeman who was just watching and when he seemed excited by what she 'd said, Dora added, " They told me I could stop bleeding if I wanted. " <p> Nothing was on television that night except the news and Dora Peg never watched that. Peg had opened her eyes once. The nurse said Peg was still very sick and so Dora did n't hit her for snoring even though the noise disgusted her. She put her sneakers back on. Shaking her wooden board to hear the pins rattle she went out to the commons room to see if the house mother would play cribbage. Not a day for mothers. Dora 's had left only a message : Dora should be ready at 10:00 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door and looked outside. Then she opened the door and - thinking of the way her mother tested a hot iron with a wet finger - spit into the darkness. Pain. She took a step feeling her stomach swirl like someone had flushed it. She 'd never gone for a walk along at night, never wanted to. In activity class last week they 'd all gathered around Dora in a circle, the teacher and the rest of the class, and she 'd been commanded : Fall. They caught her and she had wanted to do it again, but it was somebody else 's turn. Leap of Faith, the game was called. Not only Dora asked to play it again. They were never served jello twice in a row. <p> Dora thought if you were on the outside like her mother and the truck man and all the people who had houses and babies you would n't want to play the falling game, but now, as she began to walk toward the bridge with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man asked her to follow him. There was nothing to laugh about this time. She could n't see very well, the stones on the side of the black road, the teeth of a beast. She might trip and be swallowed. Dora walked slowly towards the bridge and though it had only taken then man minutes it took her almost half an hour to get to the stairs. She rolled the sleeves of her sweat shirt up thinking this might be how you catch pneumonia when you do n't feel cold. Right foot, right foot, right foot. She forced herself up the stairs. Tears kept smoothing her face and she wanted to turn back but the man called her, his husky voice over her eyes, inside her ears. A naked man with bleeding feet had died for her too. Secretly she did n't believe that, only this. <p> When Dora made it to the top where the cars went by zip, zip, zip like turning a black and white television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand and wiped the tears from her face. <p> For now she knew. Now when she went back to the commons room and then to her own bedroom where she would pull the blinds, hug her sisters and put her watch inside her jewelry box, she would know why he had jumped waiting for the next day. And when she did n't like something, she might think about what it was like up here on the bridge with the wind blowing about her like God was there. It would be horrible and she would try to laugh or shut her eyes up into a kaleidoscope but other times it would be like she could climb a mountain too if she wanted. Up here with the rubber tire angels she learned a way to feel things to herself she could not explain. <p> My sisters wear no clothes. That man made me bleed. I know how to die, mother. <p> Article copyright Iris. <p> Article copyright Iris : A Journal About Women. <p>
