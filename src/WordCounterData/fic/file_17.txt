1002441 Alice. is having a baby tomorrow. The kitchen calendar is circled. Scheduled for a c-section, Alice is perturbed by the itineraries of motherhood. She knows the preliminaries will be easy : Roger will be there, her doctor, her insurance company... but what shocks her is her lack of feeling. She wants something to happen - she wants to break down while driving through Arkansas ' Ozarks. She wants to give birth in a forest, her wetness and the wet earth two things to taste together like salt and semen. It wo n't happen. She is Alice. A pillar of strength and prudence. Tomorrow they will bill her for the scar, and she will thank them kindly for her baby, Friedman. <p>
