4160041 1 # SHATTERED # Chaos erupted. # A light so brilliant it was painful bathed Pug as # he instinctively threw all his magic into the protective shell # Magnus had erected around them just a moment before. Only # Magnus 's anticipation of the trap had prevented them all from # being instantly vaporized. Energy so intense it could hardly # be comprehended now destroyed everything at hand, reduc- # ing even the most iron- hard granite to its fundamental par- # ticles, dispersing them into the fiery vortex forming around # them. # The light pierced Pug 's tightly shut eyelids, rendering his # vision an angry red- orange, with afterimages of green- blue. # His instinct was to shield his face, but he knew the gesture # would be useless. He willed himself to keep his hands moving # in the pattern necessary to support Magnus 's efforts. Only # magic protected them from conditions no mortal could with- # stand for even the barest tick of time. The very stuff of the # universe was being distorted on all sides. # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sun. In his # studies, Pug knew this to be the fifth state of matter, beyond # R A Y M O N D E. F E I S T # 2 # earth, air, water, and fire, called different names by various # magicians : among them, flux, plasma, and excited fire. Energy # so powerful that it tore the very essentials of all matter down # to their very atoms and recombined them, repeating the pro- # cess until at some point the plasma fell below a threshold of # destruction and creation and was able finally to cease its fury. # Years of perfecting his art had gifted him with myriad # skills, some talents deployed reflexively without conscious # effort. The magic tools he used to assess and evaluate were # overloaded with sensations he had never experienced in his # very long lifetime. Obviously, whoever had constructed this # trap had hoped it would be beyond his ability to withstand. # He suspected it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind, Pug heard Miranda asking, Is everyone safe? # Nakor 's voice spoke aloud. There 's air. We can talk. # Magnus, Pug, do n't look. It will blind you. Miranda, we can # look. # Describe what you see, Magnus said to the two demons # in human form. # Miranda said, It 's an inferno hotter than anything wit- # nessed in the demon realm. It has destroyed a hundred feet of # rock and soil below us and we are afloat in a bubble of energy. # Farther out from where we stand, it 's turning sand to glass. # A wall of superheated air is expanding outward at incredible # speed, and whatever it touches is incinerated in moments. As # far as my eye can discern, all is flame, smoke, and ash. # Less than a minute before, the four of them had been ex- # amining a matrix of magic, which was obviously a lock, but # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings of energy, the Sven- ga'ri, had been pro- # tected in a quiet glade atop a massive building built by a peace- # ful tribe of the Pantathians, a race of serpent men created by # the ancient Dragon Lord, Alma- Lodaka. Unlike their more # violent brethren, these beings had been gentle, scholarly, and # very much like humans. # Now that peaceful race had been obliterated. It did n't # M A G I C I A N ' S E N D # 3 # matter to Pug that they had been created by the mad vanity # of a long- dead Dragon Lord as pets and servants : they had # evolved into something much finer and he knew he would # mourn their loss. # It 's fading, said Nakor. Do n't look. # Pug kept his eyes closed, focusing on his son 's protective # shell. You anticipated " # Magnus finished his sentence for him : " the trap. It was # just one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # arms started to tingle, and before I knew it, the protective spell # was cast. I had created a word trigger, a power word. I just had # no idea the trap would be so massive. Without your help and # Moth " Miranda 's... He let the thought go unfinished. # Pug and Miranda both chose to ignore his slip. She was n't # his mother. She was a demon named Child who was in pos- # session of all his mother 's memories, but Child seemed com- # pletely contained within Miranda. It was easy to forget she # was n't Miranda ; the experience was unnerving for all of them. # Only Belog the demon, now to outward appearances # Nakor, seemed untroubled by his situation, and that was # wholly in keeping with who Nakor had been in life : a man # of unlimited curiosity and a delight in all mysteries. His # voice held a note of awe. This was an unspeakably brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, Pug said, I tend to agree. # What 's your thinking? # Whoever fashioned this understood it could be investi- # gated only by a very limited number of people, said Nakor. # First they would have to get past the Pantathians, either by # winning their confidence or by brute force. If they reached # the matrix, few magic- using demons or lesser magicians, or # even very well- schooled priests, could have begun to under- # stand the complexities of this lock, or trap, or however you # think of it. # Miranda said, Only Pug. # Pug was silent for a moment, then said, No. It was # R A Y M O N D E. F E I S T # 4 # Magnus. I sensed the lock, but only assumed there was a trap # involved. By the time I returned from the Academy, he had al- # ready easily won past barriers that would have proved a chal- # lenge to me. # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut him off. That was no hollow praise. I have # all your mother 's memories and skills, Magnus, but you... # you are the best of both of us, I mean both your mother and #
