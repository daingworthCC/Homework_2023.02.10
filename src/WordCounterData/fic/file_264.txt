5003741 # Fanta, who is looking to buy a house, remembers something when she walks into this strange kitchen with yellow walls, low ceilings, double louver windows, and a sink deep enough to soak two days ' worth of used dishes. It 's a small memory of her at seven, at pretty Bene 's ninth birthday party. The entire street had turned out for the party, mainly to eat peppered jollof rice and stewed meat, with bottles of Coke for the children, malt and Guinness stout for the grown people. Then Benes sachet of fancy chocolates from an aunt in London vanished, just like that, causing Bene to cry so hard that the lace collar of her white taffeta dress was ruined. # The papas, mamas, aunties and uncles, along with neighborhood children old enough to understand the pain of having something so precious taken away from one on a special day, gathered around Bene to console her. The fat cake made by Ochi, the baker( best amongst bakers for fifty square kilometers), complete with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, was still there in the center of the party table-but Bene would n't look at it. The crates of soft drinks and toy whistles poked from underneath the tablecloth, but Bene did n't want to know if they existed. Birthday cards, Jackson Five on the stereo, the street photographer 's shiny new camera- she ignored them all. It was her chocolates, the ones Aunt Selina sent from London, that totally broke her heart. # The chocolates were named Giant Buttons, as Fanta found out. They came in a shiny purple pack, with a drawing of two brown-white chocolate discs on the front. The discs looked straight at Fanta like surprised eyes as she tore open the pack with nippy teeth and snuck one heavenly piece into her mouth. She was hiding behind Benes mother 's kitchen door as she ate chocolate after chocolate, standing precariously on a pile of green plantains and yam tubers long as her forearm. Her unsteady perch caused the hem of her twill dress to peek beyond the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in busy twitches-all actions missed by her excited child 's mind. Sure enough, someone caught the strange movements behind the door-Fantas own mother, who had entered the kitchen in search of extra cutlery-and there was a moment of wide-eyed shock, fury, and the memory of how sweet could quickly turn to bitter in the synchronized bat of an eyelid between mother and daughter. # Her mother got the show on the road herself. She walked behind Fanta, nudging her on with two fingers between her little girls shoulder blades, up the passage leading to the center of the party room where Bene, still sniffling, was readying to blow out her birthday candles. Fantas mother said the candle blowing would have to wait because there was a new development. She signaled Benes papa to suspend his disc jockey work and turn down the Jackson Five, signaled the photographer to stop terrorizing the smaller children with his pointy-mouthed camera. For the sake of novelty, and also because they thought that clever Fanta had a special performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They drew back, leaving Fanta a clear unrestricted circle. Even Fantas mother pulled back to give Fanta full spotlight advantage. She had seized the Giant Buttons and disappeared the pack in the folds of her maxi skirt to be revealed after Fanta made her confession. # Go on, her mother said to Fanta in the center of the circle. Tell them what you did. # Fantas face was to the floor, one cheek bulging from a still-melting piece of chocolate. # Is it a song, someone asked. Fantas mother said to the girl : they 're asking if it 's a song, what do you have to say? By then Fantas eyes were a milky mist, her heart as itchy as her school sweater. Her " show " voice, the performance voice she 'd used with the children 's choir at Christmas time, and might have used again, curled up inside her like contours of burning paper, never to be restored for the rest of her childhood and through her teenage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this unfamiliar kitchen with freshly painted yellow walls. For it was whilst inside that circle of shame and suddenly frightened by her impending confession, that Fanta forgot her little girl 's golden rule to count from one to ten till the black bird flew away. What came to her instead, as her eyes reflected blurry pictures, was the image of her papa revealed in the patterns of the floor tiles of the party room. # A few days earlier, her papa had arrived from work with a box containing a red-white kerosene stove, which he set on the table of their sitting room. It was a Butterfly model, bearing double burners and a silver control jack. It had a unique shape like a hut, with oval windows on all sides through which one could see the perforated cylinder channeling the wicks in vertical formations to the fuel tank at the base. The family-Fantas mother, Fanta, and Flowergirl the cat just delivered of four kittens-gathered around the stove to silently welcome it to its new home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the garage to make room for the Butterfly. Since gas cost thirty and kerosene twenty-eight and something, they had to stop using the more expensive one. A civil servants money does not grow on trees, her father liked to say. Tuta tuta, meaning pick it up, do n't waste anything. # So now to this kitchen Fanta is being shown. No storage cabinets. Unvarnished wooden shelves, the distinctive smell of cockroach powder tucked into corners. Fanta asks the housing agent if the landlord plans to do something about the kitchen door jamming halfway on its rusty hinges. Let 's tackle the unpleasant issues and know where we stand, she says. # The Fanta of today, looking back, could see why her mother, consumed by backwater forces, had done what she did to her little daughter at Bene 's party. It was the anguish of being wife to a miser who always tallied the sum of two ones as eleven instead of two, or two threes as thirty-three instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the judgement in her daughter 's eyes as she hid to suck on stolen chocolate. The family lived with that Butterfly stove for fifteen years before it was replaced. By then it had been painted five times over in the exact same shade of red and white, and the kitchen 's ceiling was charred black from coat upon coat of soot. The gas cylinder was never restored, never used again. It became a permanent fixture in the garage, like her father 's old car tires, a plaything for generations of geckos. Flowergirl had long retired from being a great-grandmother cat and moved on to cat afterlife. # But those backwater forces of hurt, being entities that could help one collate insight from sustained misfortune, gradually sorted her mothers perception in other ways too. For instance, the woman decided she liked Cleopatra soap for its blue and gold shiny packaging. Whenever she stepped out of the bathroom, there would be that sweet, floral fragrance but no evidence of the soap anywhere. At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soap dish was altering its usual scent, but, as she had learned from the forced confession in the circle years ago, she need n't open her mouth further than was required, not even when curiosity swept aside a curtain in her thoughts. She would not ask for trips to the zoo ; she would not request Shield deodorant like other schoolgirls were starting to wear. When one afternoon, mid-errand, she experienced a bathroom d&eacute;ja vu in a corner of her mother 's closet, Fanta looked closely. She spotted the blue and gold pack, opened it to study the delicate soap with the fading imprint of an Egyptian queen in headdress. She turned the fine soap this way and that in the light, as if that would make it explain its presence. Then, still full of questions, she returned the mystery soap to its moisture-warped box. She carefully shut the closet. # The truth, she says now to the agent. If you do n't think the landlord has any plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us the truth. A different shade of yellow has been painted over putty plugging craters in the wall. Her husband says the kitchen makes the house appear unsafe, and therefore they ca n't take it. But Fanta looks behind the door for a second time, sees a watermark spanning the splintering wood like a hand waving in salute, and she finds another reason to understand why the notion of complete honesty, like perfection, is an unattainable one. It went beyond the invisible sweet-smelling soap to yet another trait, a mantra-I have something to do-which her mother started using not long after she found a job cleaning offices in the mornings, and another one tending flowers in government bureaus in the evenings. Her mother repeated the words whenever Fantas father was n't near ; for example, on the bus when mother and daughter rode back from the food market, or in the hospital while waiting in line for the optician, or in the seamstress 's shop while Fanta got fitted for her graduation outfit. # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's multicolor years- with the splash of red lipstick, white and gold slippers, grass-green purse, blue leather-strapped wristwatch, grey hairs on a brown head -and then, one cloudy afternoon, a stout rainbow set itself firmly in the sky after a passing rain. Fanta, on that afternoon, took the bus with her mother to the magistrate court, where the woman bribed the clerk to compose an identity affidavit stating a fake date of birth and the loss of her marriage certificate, and indicating Fanta as her only kin. Fanta did not say, Mama, what are you doing? She watched the clerk type up the thing with fast strokes : I hereby declare that... # Fantas mother passed the document to her daughter to read-her eyes were dimming, the type font gave her a headache. Fanta said at the end : it 's just the way you wanted it ; your maiden name is there in place of Papas name. Fantas mother said, Good, now lets go to the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank, her mother opened an account for the first time in her life, with the affidavit to settle the cashiers questions. Then she removed from her purse bundles of money wrapped in varied packages from cellophane bags to musty, timeworn newspaper dating back to years when Fanta was learning to mask her adolescent body odor with crushed lime. Fanta looked away in shame, speechless at the foul parcels unloading on the teller 's counter. Her mother told the bank people to authorize her daughter as co-signatory. For this Fanta got a checkbook too. Outside the premises, her mother checked her blue wristwatch with a flourish. They walked through the streets, not talking, not looking at one another. There was a store before the bus stop, and her mother dropped in for a three-pack case of Cleopatra soap. Fanta watched her slip the package into her bag like a giant egg. Go on, her mother finally said. Ask me what you want to ask me. # How much will the landlord remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with a new one? If we improve the old kitchen shelves and repaint the walls? Replace the louvers with sliding windowpanes? # Mother and daughter, they rode the bus home on the day they would last sight a rainbow together. When you marry, her mother said, look for someone whose mind can sometimes think the very same things with yours. A person who will not give you dry bread when you need chicken stew and laughter. # Fantas husband motions to her with his hand : ca n't we look at a few more houses instead? -the motion says-and the agent catches that and speaks angrily. He tells the couple : this house comes with three bedrooms, a garage, a backyard big enough for a garden and parties, and so what 's the problem? Just a kitchen? It is n't up to the landlord to fix up the little things, the agent throws at them. Fantas husband thinks the agent insolent. He steps out with his wife to the balcony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reads there tells him they will have to take the house after all. Why? he asks, poking her ribs lightheartedly. Fanta tells him, we are buying after all, not renting. We can do our own repairs for a house that will last a lifetime. # Fanta, in truth, can not say that the kitchen has worked a sightseers magic on her-the scarred door that wo n't close, leading up a long passage like the one her mother led her along to her first public confession. The truth ; how to say-that now that Mama is long dead, Fanta is spending that money, paying her wifely half of this house 's cost from a bank account crafted out of her mother 's other identity. How to say, as she turns her face from her husband to look down at the backyard big enough for children 's parties, that she remembers looking her mother squarely in the face during their last bus ride together. She remembers accusing her mother : That was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money, Mama. Sidebar # ONYINYEIHEZUKWU was born in Nigeria.
