1006541 Detection may depend on deductionbut even more on recognizing odd and unexpected connections! <p> " Id iss nod, you underztand, a. zircus, " Gerhand Vilkis said. " But ve live in degenerate dimes, Knave. Peeble-many peeble do nod appreciade ze divverences, zo ve call ida arcus. " I shrugged, and gave him a friendly smile. It was the smile I save for madmen and other bothers, and he gave me one back, a little spasm of a thing that showed about three teeth. " Call it a telephone, for all I care, " I said. " The important thing is, how is the data leaking? " " Id iss, " he said-no, the Hell with it, you 've had a taste of the accent, and I wo n't bother either of us with it any more. Gerhand had been born on Groschen, and every damn Gross seems to hang on to the accent forever. He 'd lived on eight or eleven different planets, and worked on forty or fifty, but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over. Maybe it made him more plausible, or at least maybe the Intelligence Officer who 'd set him up on Pupil III thought it made him more plausible. Are circus people more likely to sound Gross? At any rate- " It is, " he said, aa carnival. Not a circus, but a carnival. Why should I call it a telephone? " Damned if I know, " I said. " The question is " Data, " he said. " Yes. Indeed so. Data. We must discover, Knave. It is vital that we discover. " I gave him another smile, a little less bright. " I suppose it is, " I said. And what the Hell, maybe it was. It was vital, at least, to Gerhand V-ilis -and vital( she had assured me) to Cecily Scriber, the Intelligence Officer who 'd called me up, during a brief stopover I 'd made back on Earth for restock, to offer me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, " I 'd told her, " caused me a great deal of pain, ruined my clothes, and did n't pay enough. It had n't been all that horriblethough during the thing, which I 've reported on somewhere or other, I had thought of having cards printed up that read, in addition to Gerald Knave : Survivor-Incompetent Spying Done Cheap. But bargaining should always start strong. " This is different, " she told me. " It should be entirely a mental exercise. You can deal with a mental exercise, ca n't you, Knave? " No need to get nasty, of course ; but Intelligence types do seem to run to it. One day Cecily and I might become friends ; but we 'll have to be very, very old, and very, very feeble, to manage to get together without striking sparks., You, " I said gently, " called me. " " True, " she said. " All too true. Shall we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said, " discuss the job first. If I 'm going to figure out how much I need to be paid for something, I want to be as clear as possible on just what the something is. " " There is an intelligence operation running on Pupil III, " she said. " The details of that operation will be made clear to you on your acceptance of the " Pupil III? " I said. " I thought the damn war was over by now " " The war has been over for six years, " she said. " That is why-at least in partI am running an intelligence operation there. " " General Stern has started another up rising? " " General Stern is in prison, " she said frostily. " Due in part to your work, I suppose, seven years ago. Minister Anthetor was able to form a stable government, and Pupil III is currently at peace. " " There 's no fighting going on? " I said. She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. But there are sympathizers, of course. Stern and his gang were defeated-shot, imprisoned, driven off-planet, it varies-but sympathizers always remain. We must keep an eye on them. Hence " Hence an intelligence operation, " I said. " A handy eye. And it 's running into trouble somehow? " " Information has been leaked, " she said. " The operation itself is obviously compromised- " " So shut it down, " I said. " If they know about it, whatever the Hell it is She sighed. " Knave, " she said, " you do not appreciate subtleties. " " All right, " I said equably. " What sub tleties am I not appreciating just at the moment? " " If the operation is shut down, " she said, " the-the Stern gang, whoever is currently at the head of the group-will know that their infiltration has been discovered. If, on the other hand, the operation continues, they will feel confident-one-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to information-a pipeline of which, they will be sure, we have no idea. " " But it 's still a pipeline to- " I started, and then my brain kicked in. " Oh. You can feed them false information, and they 'll take it as genuine- " " If, " she said, " they do not know we know of their infiltration-and if, as well, we know how the infiltration is being managed. " I thought about it for a second. " Why do you have to know that? " I said. " You can feed false information into the operation pretty much ad lib, and- " " Our people must know which is the false and which the true, " she said. " Information control must be clear and absolute. The pipeline to our opposition must work smoothly-and must contain only the false information. In order for all that to be the case " You have to know just what and where the pipeline is, and how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does sound like a quiet job of analysis at that. Just take a look at the thing, in detail, and see what 's going on, in detail. " And we agreed on a price-not a very high price : intelligence people do n't pay nearly as well as you think they 're going to-but a price that could be paid in nice, untraceable Pupil III cash, and would thereby be the Hell of a lot larger, because Comity tax officials would never have to be told about it. My rule is, never tell a tax official anything you are not forced on pain of death or severe damage to disclose. Life is much more pleasant that way. So, off I went to Pupil Ill-landing at the spaceport, which is on the outskirts of a city called Arthur, which I 'd visited once before, and wandering slowly and casually out into the countryside, and down a river to a port city called Knessel, where the Four Mile Circus was currently based. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first thing the job did was almost get me killed. I told myself at once that I could n't blame the Stern sympathizers, whoever they were, for my brush with the Great Beyond. I have tried, with fair success, not to blame me, either-yes, I was a little careless, but I blame that, when I 'm feeling cheerful enough, on a natural lack of acquaintance with circuses. Pardon me, carnivals. Gerhand kept telling me there was a difference, and I 'm willing to believe there is ; but I 'd never run into either one before. They 're popular on some worlds, including the old Original, but, what with one thing and six others, their orbits and mine had never before intersected. Carnivals, then( according to Gerhand, and why not believe him?), tend to lean more to sideshow acts( I 'll explain in a minute), games of chance( usually not quite as chancy as they look to the uninitiated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to performers of all sorts-acrobats, wirewalkers, highflyers, clowns-and animal acts : trained beasts of any and every sort. But it 's a matter of lean, not a firm line. Circuses sometimes feature sideshow acts, or even the occasional game of chance ; carnivals often have an animal act or two, and a scattering of performers, especially highflyers and clowns. Two fast footnotes. 1) Sideshow acts are one- or two-person shows put on for small audiences at an extra fee( you pay to get into the carnival, and then you pay a little more to see the sideshow acts) : magicians, fire-eaters( a minor act on most worlds, but very popular on Pupil III, for some damn reason), a variety of human oddities like very fat people, very thin people, people who look like dogs or turtles or something else just as unsettling-anything you might be willing to pay money out for, to stare at a while. 2) Animal acts-exhibitions of trained beasts-range in size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have trained damn near anything, apparently, and though the Four Mile Circus( carnival) carried only an elephant show, some trained walking-trees and a flea circus( which is never called a flea carnival, possibly because fleas do n't have side-shows or games of chance), Gerhand told me of circus acts he 'd either run into or reliably heard about that included tigers, crocodiles, and-though I would have to see this one to believe it-Rasmussen 's biting saurians. None of which turned up during this little job of quiet analysis-and none of which were needed. The damn elephants did just fine all by themselves. I 'd shaken hands with Gerhand( his was small, horny and hot) and decided to soak up some atmosphere-get an idea of how the Four Mile Circus operated. I already knew how the information transfer to Cecily Scriber and her intelligence net operated-by coded pulse from Gerhand 's office to an operative, or spy if you like simple words as much as I do, based about half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked at a nice, undemanding kind of job-assistant manager, I think it was. He 'd been an operative( spy) for Cecily Scriber for twelve years or so ; Gerhand Vilkis and the Four Mile Circus, on the other hand, had been in her pay only eight or nine Pupil months( say eight and a half Standard), when she 'd somehow or other managed to snaffle him, and a few of his employees, into collecting bits of data for her and passing them on. I 'd look into the pulse setup later ; but the show was revving up to a start, and looking that over seemed the best opening move. So I went out into the midwaywhich is a carnival 's main street, just a very, very broad lane flanked by tents. The tents feature acts of all sorts-I passed a magician 's tent, not yet trying to rope in customers, with a flea circus across from it ; then there was a sort of mad athlete-a fellow who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that, for five or six admiring or sickened gawkers. As I passed, he unknotted himself. He picked up a ukulele, of all the damn things, and began to tune it( which meant nothing to me, at the time), and played six or eight bars of something or other, very lively stuff. Then he grinned, held the ukulele, and started to tell the gawkers that much more surprising acrobatics would take place inside the tent, for a small fee which would be collected by the friendly fellow standing right there in front of it.... Across from him was a kind of Female act, which had drawn a lot more than five or six gawkers, none of whom were looking even faintly sickened. It 's another standard feature of carnivals, Gerhand had told me-dancing girls( dancing women, if you subscribe to the vagaries of FemLib), most of whom shed as much of their clothing as local custom makes even remotely possible. Some of the girls( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harsh critics of terpsichore in the audience at any given time. And even fewer subscribers to FemLib, come to think of it. The next tent past the self-knotting fellow was a very large one, built square, and the smell permeated the midway. It was the elephant show, and three elephants were parading around just in front of it, each one using its trunk to hold the tail of the one ahead of it-taking up a lot of space and being overseen by a man in a sparkling red costume, with a long black whip and what looked like a large, very shiny slug gun. Other people were pushing and shoving all along the midway-the Four Mile Circus( I have no idea where the name came from, and for all I know it 's a traditional name for circuses-or, of course, carnivals) had been having a good season at Knessel. They were booked to stay for another week, before moving on to Arthur and then to six other towns on the continent-near almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scriber had dependable spies. What pushed and shoved its way past me just then was a small dog-of the poodle persuasion, I think, but I am not checked out as an expert on small pets. At any rate, the thing was no more than nine inches long, and four or five high, and it was covered with curly white hair, or fur, or some such damn stuff. It was yapping to beat all Hell, and it went right on yapping as its owner, a woman with iron-gray hair, a hatchet face and a grim set to her mouth and shoulders, gave a small eek of surprise and dismay. The leash had somehow slipped out of her hand, and the dog had become a yapping, furry missile, targeted on the nearest leg of the nearest elephant. The man in the sparkling red costume, of course, leaped to the defense of his massive great beast as the dog streaked forward, trailing its useless damn leash behind it. He cracked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't audible, over the yapping of the dog, the first set of panicked shrieks from the crowd, and the sudden trumpeting of the elephants as the dog reached its target zone, and sank its damn fangs into the target elephant 's leg. The elephant shook its leg, once, and the little dog went flying backward. It did n't hit the grim lady-quite-but whizzed right on by, its yap revised into a high-pitched and strangled yip, heading straight up, and over the tent of the dancing girls. The dancing girls were no longer in evidence, being sensible people-but nobody had time to notice that. The technical term for what was happening was " Stampede. " I had no time to track the flying dog further : the stampede-one maddened elephant, and two companions anxious to help out, all of them trumpeting in weird hooting blasts-was heading straight for me, or as straight as made no difference. Around me people were flying into panic and fleeing in every direction. I waited about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flee at, and headed across the midway. The dancing-girls " tent looked deserted, but I was n't after company ; I wanted shelter. Not that the tent-which was some sort of brown canvas painted with wide pink stripes-would delay a stampeding elephant much more than three seconds, if that-but it was better than the open midway, and if I could get into it and past it I 'd be invisible for a minute or so, and able to find my way to a safer spot, which, after all, had to exist somewhere. The dancing girls apparently had much the same idea, and had departed the tent for fresh fields and pastures new, as the man says ; I went through a litter of bangles, scraps of costume and a ricketylooking mechanical soundbox, still playing something vaguely Arabian, without stopping to take inventory. Then I heard the shots-four of them, spaced fairly quickly, and sounding very flat and small. A slug gun I was n't familiar with, I told myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ litter to see if I could help pick up some of the pieces. That was my mistake. That the damn big gun I 'd seen the trainer holding was loaded with blanks, and was meant only to make a more-or-less convincing noise with which to command the elephants, had n't occurred to me ; I thought, naturally, that-now the beasts had gone nuts-he 'd shot them dead. I was coming back more slowly than I 'd gone out, but when the damn elephant came through the tent as if it had been gauze, and trumpeted at me, I turned yet again, and sped out the back as if the entire population of Hell had been after me. The elephant moved faster than I 'd thought a thing that size was at all likely to move. I nipped around a corner, turned again, found myself back on the midway, and angled toward the flea circus. There were more shots, and then more trumpeting-and then, slowly and raggedly, silence. It seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later) that the blanks had worked, slowly-and the sudden disappearance of available targets had worked even better. Humans had vanished from the vicinity, and the elephants, hearing the repeated gunshots, finally came to what I suppose passes for their senses, and stopped in mid-midway, so to speak, looking at one another, shrugging, and muttering the elephant equivalent of-Well, I just felt like a nice little run, you know? Good for the circulation. You too? But explanation, as I say, came later. What came then was the silence, and a man who looked just a little like the fool dog that had started everything, who was sitting calmly in a caneback chair and staring at me. After a second, I realized that the resemblance was mostly due to the white hair. I have seldom seen anyone so hairy : he was about five feet tall, and had enough white hair on his head, as beard and moustache, and down his bare arms( he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @) to stock a mattress factory. His eyes peered from under bushy white eyebrows, and they were a bright, cheerfully alert blue. He looked to be about eighty. " Huh, " he said, in a cracked baritone, a little hoarse with age. " Jerko actin " up again? " Jerko? " " The animal, " he said. -Called Jumbo, you know, but I say Jerko, myself. Supposed to be smart beasts, elephants. Never believed that much, you know. One small human trains " em to do tricks ; a smart elephant would learn the tricks, eat the human, and go into business on its own-ai n't I right? By the way, who the Hell are you? " I gave him my name, withholding comment on the intelligence of elephants. " Maori Ruskin, " he said. " Sole proprietor, Ruskin 's Flea Circus. Nice to meet you. You were sayin ', about Jerko? " I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog bit one of the elephants. Started a stampede. But they 've calmed down now. " " Little white poodle dog? " he said. I nodded. " Knew that animal 'd be trouble, first time I set an eye on the critter, " he said. " Gal owns the thing comes by ever " few days, takes another gawk at the show. Some do that-mad on circuses, some people. " He shook his head. " Dog sits down in the midway, yawns, scratches itself till Hell wo n't have it. Just sits while she goes explorin '. But one day, I said to m'self-one day, that critter 'll mean trouble. " " You were right, " I said. He shook his head. " Stupid beasts, " he said. " Elephants, stampedin '. I mean to say-start a thing, you ought a follow it through. Not stop right smack in the middle and go back to marchin " round with somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anybody get hurt? " " Do n't know, " I said. " I was a little too busy myself, getting out of the way. " He nodded. " Ayuh, " he said. " Big, ai n't they? Bigger when they 're comin " at you. Just in from off-planet, are you? " Just landed last week, " I said, assuming he 'd caught a non-Pupil accent in my voice. " Heard about the circus, came on down to see it. Did n't expect quite so much excitement. " Ruskin 's clipped tone was getting to me ; I fought it off. " It 's an interesting show, what I saw of it-lots of new things. New to me, anyhow. " " New? Nothin " in the show under four hundred years old-bar the walkin'trees, you know. Magic, fire, girls, elephants-been shows like that since Hector was a pup. Fire act near as popular as the girls, on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head. " Fleas, too-not so many now, but there 's still a few of us, you know. Train the little critters, care for " em, show " em off. Ever seen a performin " flea? " " I never have, " I said. " How in God 's name do you train anything that small? " " Professional secret, " he said. " Truth of it is, Mr. Knave-I just write the instructions out real tiny. That 's the trick, you know-gettin " the writin " tiny enough. " He nodded at me. " That, and teachin " the critters to read, you know. " So-through a magnifier he provided-I watched some fleas march, and shoot off a miniature cannon, and form themselves into letters-an A, an 0, a T. I had never seen anything like it, and it was damn near worth the trip to Pupil III to stare at the little things for a while. But I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the disaster done with, the midway was opening up again, and he wanted to be trolling for customers. I saw a little more of the midway, and ambled on back to Gerhand 's offices, which were in a small tent set behind the midway string, on my right. Gerhand was busy talking to a grim woman I had no trouble recognizing. And if I 'd had any, the damn hairy dog she had in her arms-the thing looked undamaged, but torpid, and no wonder-would have reminded me. As I came in he was saying : " Free animals. We do not allow it to be free animals on this lot. We have put at the entrances a sign " Pookie was n't free, " she said. Her voice was much milder than her looks, a nice calm contralto. " Or loose, or unleashed. I know about your rule. I 've seen your circus before, Mr. Vilkis. I had him on his leash, as I always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke, " he said. NMs. Endicott, we are determined on our rules. The dog is small ; to break, the leash must have been very thin. Ordinary care- " " It did n't break, it slipped, " she said. aI must have been holding it wrongPookie just tore it right out of my hand. I do n't understand it ; he 's never done that before. " " Perhaps he reacts badly to elephants, " Gerhand said. Then he noticed me, standing near the tent-flap door. " One moment only, Mr. Knave, " he said. " I am discussing with Ms. Endicott the recent situation- " " He 's seen elephants before, " the Endicott woman said. " He 's seen these elephants before-we both like circuses, and Pookie and I have visited yours several times. It was simply an accident, and if you 'll allow, we 'll say no more about it. " " But I can not allow, " Gerhand said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleeing in terror. This is not good for the Four Mile Circus. There will be repairs ; there will be calming down of local citizens. Expenses will exist. " " It is not our fault, " she said. " But if you insist on assessing damages, I 'm sure we can arrive at a reasonable figure. " " Certainly, " Gerhand said, smiling for the first time. " Mr. Knave, perhaps you will wait elsewhere for a short time, while we discuss. " " No, Knave, " she said. " No, this wo n't take a minute. No need to disturb you at all. I 'm sure whatever figure Mr. Vilkis names will be fair and equitable. " Gerhand 's smile got bigger. He said something polite, and named a sum. The woman 's eyebrows went up, and he reduced the sum by five per cent. She nodded. " Payment by check will be satisfactory? " she said. He nodded again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The damages will have been severe, " he said. " Write to me, " she said. " I 'm sure your figure will be acceptable ; and Knave here is a witness to my statement. There will be no trouble-as long as dear Pookie is safe, and he is. " She gave the white, hairy thing one fleeting look of adoration, looked back at Gerhand long enough to smile politely, and then turned the polite smile on me, upping it just a fraction. " We really must go now, " she said. " It 's been a terrible shock for Pookie, you know. That great beast was in a panic, of course-but Pookie might have been badly hurt. " One more adoring look for the dog-duration about a fifth of a second-and a brief : " Goodbye, Mr. Vilkis. Goodbye, Knave " -and she was gone. " It is not customarily such a simple thing, this business of damage, " Gerhand said. " No, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's get down to our business. " We discussed possibilities for a while. Stealing electronic information is done in one of two ways : in situ or in transit. Either you go to the source and lift the data while it 's sitting in spools or on disks or arranged in some kind of circuit-in situ-or you snatch at the stuff as it 's beamed out-in transit. In this case, stealing the stuff in situ did n't look possible. Most of it existed only in Gerhand 's head until he sent it out by coded pulse to one of Cecily Scriber 's tame spies ; and while telepathy is a lovely notion, human beings do n't have it. There exist telepathic races-no member of which was anywhere on Pupil Ill. It 's possible for a human being to sneak onto a human world without being detected by Customs, police or the like. In fact, it happens every damn day, somewhere : businesses called Illegal Immigration and Smuggling are built on it. But a non-human has special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a human world. If the planet had had a diplomatic mission from one of the telepathic races, I 'd have given the mission and its members some thought. Who knows which side of a human-versus-human fight any nonhuman person is going to pick to be on? As things stood, though.. The theft had to be made in transit. " May God send it to damnation, Mr. Knave, " Gerhand said. " It is a coded pulse. Such things are not simple to locate, or to learn of indetectably. " " All right, " I said. " But there are methods-and any halfway competent data thief would know two. Or six. Assume he can find the beam, and tap it. " " It is not a powerful signal, " Gerhand said. " The receptionist must be within a small range-half of a mile is good, but very much over that and the signal is lost. Closer is better. " He shook his head. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If some person traps the signal, what has he for his troubles? He has a hash of things, Mr. Knave. He does not know the code. What use is a hash? " I avoided making the joke ; Gerhand was very truly worried. " Codes can be broken, " I said. " There may be an unbreakable code-or cipher, they 're not the same thing-somewhere, some day ; people keep coming up with good tries. But there is n't one here and now-and Cecily Scriber certainly -- " No names! " Gerhand said. al beg of you, no names! " " For God 's sake, " I said. " Nobody 's going to recognize her name here-except the person who 's stealing your data, and he already knows it. Or she does, what the Hell. Anyhow, whoever it is I 'm not naming, she certainly has n't come up with an unbreakable code all of a sudden. " Gerhand sighed. Windily. " Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the data, he must be close by. Near. Within range. " " Half a mile, " I said. He shook his head. " Much less, " he said. " He must select out the coded pulse from a mix of other beams, other noises-lights, directions, many varieties of communication. A carnival is very complex, Mr. Knave-he must select out. This must limit his range. The receptionist " Receiver, " I said, unable to resist a second time. " The receiver, then-he has his equipment set to the right frequency, the right power, all. But the thief does not. " " Well, " I said, " once our data thief finds the right frequency and so on " It is changed for each new message, " Gerhand said. " On a system I think he would have to ask me, or the receptionist, to provide. He can not hunt each time from a distance of half of a mile ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. His eyes were small and black. " That is what gives me fright, " he said. " The thief 's being closer? " I said. " He must be on the lot, " Gerhand said. " He must be part of the carnival. " It sounded plausible : somebody in the damn carnival was picking up Gerhand 's broadcasts and passing them on to the Stern network, maybe by beam and maybe in any one of sixty other ways, including simply meeting a Stern operative( spy) and telling him( or her) the latest news. The trouble was, of course, that nobody in the carnival was a native of Pupil III. A motive for hooking up with Stern 's people would have to have been the same motive that had hooked Gerhand up with Cecily Scriber, representing Minister Anthetor. Money, God knows, is a common motive-what the Hell, it was mine just then-but Gerhand would n't agree. " It is a closed society, this carnival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us, he is with us every day and all day : he does not go home from his job, you understand. His home and his job are the same : they are here. We know each other, Mr. Knave, and we trust each other. " " All the same, " I said, " wave a bundle of cash at somebody, and he may turn out to be pliable. It 's been known to happen. " " True, all too true, " he said. " But the money-how would he spend it? How would he account for it? " It was a good question. The circus( carnival) was n't all that heavily manned( or womanned, or, I suppose, personed) ; as the group traveled from Knessel to Arthur to whatever town was next, everybody would get to know a very great deal about everybody else. Somebody suddenly coming into strange new globs of money would get noticed fast. But- You 're being paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing you with extra- " " No names! he cried, and went on, more quietly : " Again, true. But it is I who performs the bookkeeping for the Four Mile Circus. It is I who spends the money I receive-from a source we do not name-on repairs, on salaries, on the thousands and hundreds of demands of the Four Mile Circus. " " Right, " I said. " If I pay a little more, if I keep in better repair a tent or a platform-who will question or notice? But what is true for me, it is not true for any other person. " " So if he 's getting money, " I said, " or she is-it 's not being spent. It 's being saved up until the person leaves the circus " Carnival. " " Carnival-for some other job. Or just being socked away as an old-age pension. " " It must be so, " he said. And so it had to be, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of deductions seem a lot less probable. People being bribed to do something underhanded are not usually planning to sock the bribe away and let it sit in a mattress somewhere. Bribes tend to be right-now money. But if Gerhand was right about the range requirement, it did look as if we had an oddity on our hands. And what the Hell, oddities do happen. Logic is a wonderful thing, but it can, after all, be overstrained. So I wandered out, and watched some sideshow acts, and when the midway shut down for a couple of hours between shows I started talking to people. I began with Maori Ruskin, of course, since I 'd already met him. Naturally, I did n't simply walk into the tent and ask him about data theft-but a few casual queries about this and that established his innocence for all practical purposes. Ruskin had been with the circus( carnival) for fifty-three years-he 'd signed on, originally, to Gerhand 's father. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I 'd go back and look at Ruskin again-I 'd go back and look at everybody again-but he was a conditional No. That was the trouble : everybody was conditional. Miniaturization being what it is, the materials for data theft could be hidden in a hollow tooth, and the materials for a tight-beam broadcast to some Stern sympathizer or other did n't have to take up much more in the way of visible space. You 'd need an antenna of some sort, but a couple of inches of hairthin wire would do. And there did n't have to be a tightbeam broadcast, of course-the stuff, once stolen, could be passed on by any method the thief found handy. So I left Ruskin, with a few kind words for his performing damn fleas, and went on to other candidates. There was no lack of candidates. I talked with four of the dancing girls, I talked with the self-knotting fellow, I talked with the damn elephant handler and with the two translators assigned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of a long, long day 's( and evening 's) worth of conversation. I talked to a Signor Flame, too, and a little of that may be worth reporting. Signor Flame was a tall, black-browed man with graying, curly hair and the dark stare of a hypnotist. He was a fireeater by trade-and, as I expressed interest in the trade, and as I was a guest of Gerhand Vilkis, who paid him every week, he was friendly and talkative. " The thing to watch out for, " he said, " is coryza. Coryza has killed more than a few of us, Mr. Knave. " Coryza is another name for the common cold-still rampant on Pupil III, as it is on six or seven planets where interesting viral mutations have taken place-just as Mr. Knave is another name for me. I generally tell people who call me Mr. Knave that I prefer Knave, but, since I was by way of being a spy this trip, or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go, and used Mr. Knave, more or less, as an alias. But the common cold, however mutated and however much of a nuisance, does n't kill people. I said as much, and Signor Flame nodded. We were sitting in his living-tent, a warm, cluttered little place that did n't even seem to be fireproofed. " The stopped-up nose, the itchy feeling, the slight fever-who cares? " he said, and waved a hand. Grandly : he did everything grandly. " But the cough-the cough, Mr. Knave, is a murderous enemy. When we begin to cough, we breathe in-quickly, sharply. It 's a reflex. " " And if you happen to have your mouth full of flames at the time " Exactly, " he said. " I am very careful about all such things-coughs, sneezes, hiccups. We all are, we fire-eaters. " I nodded. " It would n't be the right trade for a person with a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allergies are controllable, " he said. aI myself have several-to coconut fiber, for instance, and to some animal hair. " " Coconut fiber sounds easy enough to avoid, " I said. " I do n't even know if coconuts are grown on-planet-if there are any, they may be imported. " " Animals, " Flame said darkly, " are everywhere. " He gestured around the tent as if summoning up hordes of hairy things. " Well, there are the elephants, " I said. " And the fleas. " His laugh was a small bark. " With fleas I have no difficulty, " he said. " And Girigu knows well enough to keep away from me, him and his immense beasts too. But cats and dogs-horses-you would not believe how many horses there are even in cities, on this pill of a planet, Mr. Knave-last week I canceled a performance. " " Because of a horse? " I said. " A dog, " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen the beast before, but its owner-some awful woman-pressed up close to the bally platform for some reason. Luckily, this happened before I began my act at all. And what could I do? The dog was in her arms-an animal running free is forbid on this lot, of course-and I could not single her out and tell her to leave. " " So you canceled the show? " " I made some excuse or other, " he said, waving his arms. " I can not even remember what. She was not there two hours later, when I began again ; and I have not seen her since. But you can imagine. " " I certainly can, n I said. And after a little more chat I got out of there. It was all over but the thinking. I knew who-and so, probably, do you by now. I 'd had a strong hint earlier, and Signor Flame had just given me another one, and two hints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, and an attack of elephants. What I did n't know was how. And I had to know how : the idea was n't to stop the data theft, but to detail it, and let it continue-con tinue stealing just the data Cecily Scriber and her busy little coterie of spies would put together for them. So I went back to Gerhand 's office tent and told him to make a phone call. Then I got busy rigging the tent. Ms.. Fic trying to look friel with a face too grim to allow of it, turned up about an hour later : " Now, " she said, width no preliminary chat whatever, " what can the trouble be? I 've been most fair with you. I have even lett Pookie tied up outside-sce animals seem to disturb you people so mui And- " " It is only a matter of some details, " Gerhand said smoothly. He gave her his best smile. " In assessing the damages which there will have been, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a corner, looking at a copy of a circus( carnival) trade journal called Bally Times. Stuck to the page I was reading with such attention was a readout. If the Endicott woman was electronically rigged-as I was sure she had to bethe readout would tell me. It had a very small range, but if the data thief was arguing with Gerhand right there in the tent, the readout would tell me. She 'd have to be rigged every time she visited the circus( carnival), of course : Gerhand 's transmissions did n't take place at set times. Miniaturization is a wonderful thing. So is logic, but the wonders of logic began to escape me as I saw the readout, which was showing a nice clean Negative. Damn it-fire-eaters were very popular on Pupil III. The damn woman had visited the Four Mile Circus over and over-and had turned up at the fireeater 's show exactly once. And then there was Mr. Knave. Lots of people call me Mr. Knave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Circus people all did. But the Endicott woman had called me Knave. More than once. So she 'd heard of me, somehow. And the obvious answer was : by stolen beam, when Cecily told Gerhand I was coming, or Gerhand acknowledged it. And Signor Flame had provided me with a second oddity, and two were enough. When combined with the damn dog 's attack on the elephants, when I happened to be nearby, they were more than enough. The leash had slipped, for the one and only time, and the dog had been goosed or trained or instructed to bite an elephant-with luck, I 'd be trampled in the ensuing melee, and no one the wiser. Except that my readout said that the woman was n't rigged. She had to be, did n't she? But she was n't. Gerhand looked over at me-casualty ; he was n't bad at it-and I started to give him a very small and baffled negative sign-when the thing dawned on me. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it really mattered. I gave him a different sort of sign, and left the tent quietly-Gerhand and Ms. Endicott( on my cue to Gerhand) were getting noisy about details of payment, somehow or other, and thus not noticing me-and saw the dog-Pookie, for God 's sake-sitting quietly, tied by its leash to a tent-peg. I petted the damn hairy thing-noticing that it was n't a mechanical dog, damn it, which had been my first ideaif the woman was n't rigged, then she owned a rigged( i.e., mechanical) dog. Was logic( or what passes for logic as it bounces around in my head) betraying me entirely? Then I remembered Maori Ruskin, and I smiled, and I untied the dog. The animal was n't mechanical, and rigging a small dog as a data thief is difficult, without leaving large traces. The whole operation can be mechanized, but strapping it onto the dog is all too showy, and gluing it onto the dog somehow or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them get irritable, and scratch even more than usual, probably damaging your rig. Surgical insertion of components might have been possible, but wildly unlikely-we had a data thief here, and bringing in a spy( or another spy) who was also an accomplished veterinary surgeon seemed a little too desperate. No, pass the woman, and pass the dog. Which left only one answer. The need for antennae bothered me for a second, but an inch-and-a-half antenna( retractable) offered no real problem : it was, after all, a very hairy dog. When I got back to the tent the discussion was in full spate. Ms. Endicott was saying : " -certainly will not pay for a full new set of costumes for dancers, in addition to- " Pookie wandered in, and yapped briefly. Ms. Endicott stopped, turned and gathered the beast into her arms. " Now, did you break your leash, you poor thing? " she said. " Or did someone try, perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will not further discuss this, " Gerhand said. He 'd caught my signal : this time the readout had been positive. " You are right : the costumes will be my expense. But please, Ms. Endicott-let us make an end now. The dog is a disturbance-and once again unleashed- " " Just so you understand- " she said, getting up. zI won't- " " I am in complete understanding, " Gerhand said, and the data thief-thieves-I suppose-went on out-medical, mtm turized, and riding on the dog. Away back near the start of this, I mentioned that self-knotting fellow tuning his ukulele. As I said, it meant nothing to me at the time. But damn it, it should have meant something : it was a message from God, or Fate, or whatever name you have for such things. First of all, because " ukelele, " in the Lost Language of the islands of Hawa(ii), means " flea. "( No one knows what ever happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with another lost island, Atlantis.) Second, because a ukelele tunes G C EA. And musicians( and I 've known a few musicians, here and there) have a little song that goes with those four notes. You 've probably heard it-it 's positively ancient, perhaps centuries preSpace. Right. My dog has fleas.
