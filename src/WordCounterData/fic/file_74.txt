1011141 In ancient days, Chukchansis cremated their dead <p> Old history 's words both in dry phrase <p> And condescending journal entry gives record. <p> The dead one 's band would kindle a huge fire <p> And host a night-long dance. Drums and deer hooves ' <p> Rattling pulse gave furious mourning to the dead <p> As women would circle and begin to dance. Around <p> And around the pyre, ever quicker around, they 'd spin <p> In frenzied cadence to fire, to the night, to loss. <p> Cinders springing from fire to dancers <p> Would singe the women 's hair, blacken their faces <p> While dust and sweat from the violence of grieving <p> Joined with smoke and the color of flame <p> To carry the dead one 's body away from the earth, <p> Body gone to find death-stolen spirit. <p> Then, when flames had morphed to cool grey ash and <p> Fragments of bone, our ancients in honoring tradition <p> Would never speak the name of the dead again. <p> When I die do n't cry or wail, do n't grieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just sew my ashes <p> Into your mattress to soften your sleep <p> Where, selfish and vicious as any old witch woman, <p> I 'll warily keep watch through all your nights <p> And will slip into the erotic arcady of your drowsing <p> Filling it so full of memory you 'll weep joyous dreams <p> And awaken so contentedly from the night <p> That you will want no other woman. <p> But, sweet man, if you should the before me <p> Leaving me in this sterile and too civilized world, <p> Where satin pillows and pious prayers are given the dead <p> In quiet rooms that give no welcome to the old gods <p> Or to me, I 'll go out and find a wild, natural place. <p> And build a fiery mound on raw and rocky dirt <p> I 'll throw my love for you into the kindle <p> Of sticks, the broken branches of native trees, and <p> Dry vines gathered as the whips of my sorrow. <p> I 'll shriek and wail around that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you until my naked feet are cracked <p> And blistered, around and around until in a furied rhythm <p> The flames themselves come to dance with me. <p> Spinning around that climbing, growling circle of fire <p> Until the ashes of mourning are all that is left of its flame, <p> I 'll dance and dance until my spirit follows yours, <p> Until the dance is broken to such silence <p> That never again will I say your name. <p> Article copyright News from Native California. <p>
