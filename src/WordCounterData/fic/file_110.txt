1016641 On a night in September Grace Elvey drove up her road and found her driveway swarming with firefighters and her house in flames. She got out of the car and walked forward, disbelieving. <p> " Your house is totaled, " called out a teenage girl named Missy, who lived next door. <p> Missy 's mother leaped at Grace and took her hand. <p> Flames burst out in patches on the house, like dull explosions. It was a cold, damp night. An odd night for a fire, she thought. A strange, loud, continual noise, the hoses and something else, a crackle like the radio turned up too loud, filled the glowing bowl where her house used to be. <p> But her husband 's shirts were inside that house. And his guitar, his wisdom teeth, his raven feather, oh his books. Two years since he died. There were things she had not touched in that time, sitting on shelves. " Wait, " she said suddenly and took a step forward. <p> Quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be so many things like that -- all but forgotten things she lifted out of the flow of years and set aside. And no list of them, no catalogue. At the thought of so much vanishing in a night, she felt a sense of wonder. " God " -- she started to say, surprising herself. <p> The firefighters moved around like big hardshelled bugs in their green coats. One end of the house had turned to velvet now. And leaned in on itself. You could see through the bedroom windows. You could imagine someone caught inside, diving out. Grace stood with Missy 's mother, gripping her hand, openmouthed. <p> She thought of the paint-by-numbers sets in the closet. A secret habit, something odd and silly to pass the time in the evening. There were several shoved under the couch, too. Had she ever showed them to anyone? Oh God, she thought, I hope they burn up too -- how awful to have them dug out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the living room and books and other things are gone. <p> It was the chimney. Something caught fire inside the chimney. Grace always had the chimney cleaned out. Not yet this year. She tried not to let things get away from her. Though things piled up. <p> Grace tried to be a careful woman, with no habit of leaving the stove burners on, or the steam iron plugged in. She knew, standing there in the street, that she was without fault. This thing just flared up because of life, because of chemistry, not because of any tragic flaw in her personality. Like when her husband died. He was in fine health, then he was gone. What we think of as fine health held a strand of mortality. No fault in his diet. Not her fault. It was just out there -- this complicated, deep current of life. We do n't know what 's in it. It 's complicated, its huge, life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did I do wrong. Oh, God, what did I do. <p> The cul de sac where the neighbors stood, watching the fire, was deep with sodden birch leaves. The neighbors were awed and gentle, except for Missy and a few others, on whom the fire worked like a stimulant. Missy could n't help herself. Nonetheless, Grace wanted to slap her when Missy turned and said " Wow. " <p> Spices. One thing Grace could n't bring herself to throw away was an outdated jar of coriander or oregano. She had boxes of allspice and cloves from the 1960 's, and now that she thought about it, that was many years to have passed -- a generation -- time for a whole revolution, time for Columbus to have discovered spices in the first place, or whoever did. Of course it was n't Columbus. It was Marco Polo, maybe. Books. Look it up in a book. Black and crumbling, holding their shape like a timed joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next day an insurance man gave her an inventory form. But why would I want to replace old spices and how could you ever replace a book collection, she thought. <p> It 's not the things you can replace that matter. Everyone who knew Grace or read about the fire, sent her something soft and warm to make up for a lifetime of possessions, to ease the ache. Instead of old spices and old love letters, old things from a not always sweet married life, she now could turn her attention to the boxes of afghans, sweaters, socks and mufflers that inundated the neighbor 's house, where she was staying. Two dozen pairs of army surplus green socks. <p> Grace sat down once in front of the inventory form and a star of pain burst inside her as she began to read the list of household possessions, line by line, room by room. There was a very small space for books. " Attach more sheets as needed, " the insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was n't supposed to list her own, surely. She folded the papers and ran the side of her hand down the fold, again and again, and pushed it away, across the desk, like a plate of fatty meat in a restaurant when you 're suddenly full. She picked up a letter just arrived from her oldest son. He was coming to Fairbanks to see her, he promised. Words on a page -- something to save, something to own. Once she lived a life as complicated and tracked up with things as any one else 's ; now she was captain of three boxes of donated warm things and one letter. So! <p> She remembered suddenly the one, velvet-lined drawer in her ancient jewelry case that held her husband 's wisdom teeth, broken because the dentist had so much trouble digging them out and Edward had been sick for three days afterwards, dizzy from pain medication, and in that drawer were the children 's baby molars, too -- she just tossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the jar of water next to their pillow -- replaced by a dime, or a quarter. She looked at the box of sweaters next to her, in the Goldens ' underfurnished guest room, and thought suddenly : what I 'd give to see something really strange. Like a handful of broken teeth in a velvet drawer. <p> Or a box of spices from 1962. <p> Or Edward 's records, bootlegged Bob Dylan and scratchy, ancient recordings of Leadbelly. And the silk robes he brought back from Vietnam. Heavy silk, falling over her legs like water. Edward opening the robe, or she letting it fall open, that time she sat back with her legs open and let him see her, really see her, let him look, that time. It all comes down to one memory. One memory at a time. <p> Her knees up, and the lights on, and the sky outside the bedroom window, and Edward 's face -- so kind, so willing, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would the replacement cost be for three silk robes? Another war, a soldier prowling ancient city streets, thinking of silk opening to show him white knees, white legs, dark hair, parted, yes, he parted the hair. To look at, to touch, to inventory. <p> She was staring across the room, living inside that moment again, but now she looked down at the desk, at Howard 's letter, and she thought that she had no control at all over her thoughts anymore -- this fire was turning out to be like Edward 's death after all, she tried to take things in order, she had tried that -- especially after Edward died, to cut every project in half, or quarters or bits and do first one bit then the other. One little piece at a time. <p> But now she could n't do anything. Just like when Edward died. She would start dreaming. And the dreams would lock. her in place at the kitchen table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward and the depth of his voice, the hoarseness. <p> He was thin when he came back from Vietnam. No, not really thin, but just not the great stunning lout her loneliness had made of him. The skin on his shoulders, and where it sloped to his breast, was pale, mottled, tight. Almost transparent. He grew a beard. She put her mouth in the beard.. Her mouth against his bearded face. Deep, like a jungle. She liked that, a mouth full of hair. Then his eyes lit up and he took her face in his hands and said, so close their lips were touching, and he smiling all the time, " Wife-to-be. My unwed wife. " <p> She wanted to go on loving him. She wanted to watch him grow old. White in his hair and new expressions on his face. Maybe noticing her again. Looking across the room, marveling. But truly he had become a bit disappointed, bored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet and placid, so linear, he used to say. One step at a time. Do n't leave anything out. You might regret it. He 'd always smile and touch her shoulder gently when he teased her that way. She 'd put her hand to his neck and tug at a spike of hair in return. Or they 'd smack each other 's bottom, when no one else was around. She was happy, did n't he see. <p> Edward 's raven feather. He stopped going to church when he got back from Vietnam. They were teaching in Sitka and. he prowled the beach, watching the gulls, eagles, and ravens. He read out loud to her from Native mythology. He ' decided that Raven was the creator. She thought it was touching, that he had simply made a substitute, like Equal for sugar, or something -- one creator for another. Why a creator at all, she wondered. Why not just a sense, a flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, why not just gravity, or wings? Why a master intelligence behind it all. Why not paganism? Why not the wonder of molecules attracting each other to create, say, a doorknob? <p> The raven feather was many-textured, smooth as silk then fractured anti rough and deep, black to blue from the quill outward. Edward said, once, looking at it on the cabinet in the living room, " I always want to have things like this around me. " Just suddenly, out of the blue, a statement coming from a conversation he was having with himself. <p> She was the one who saved the boys ' drawings and paintings and earliest scribblings. Howard and Carl. One a steady quiet English professor, linear like his mom, wrote poems that way -- scratch by scratch, word by word, every morning from seven to nine. <p> The other one a mountain climber. Could n't get far enough away from earth. Although Carl was the one who aborted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him in a tent on the mountainside for two days until help arrived. If you had to depend on one person, it would be good if that person was Carl, who could turn all of his restlessness to stone when it was necessary. And hold your hand. <p> But, best not to depend on anyone. A nice enough moment, a moment of dependence could be ; but best not to stay there. Stay independent by doing your job. And the job now is to take the inventory, fill out the form, get your money. If your house burns down, you fill out the form. Just like anything else in life : if you get a job, you got to show up ; if you have a child, you stop running around ; if you fall in love, you take off your clothes. Like she did, when she was twenty, with Edward. In a converted schoolbus parked in a meadow, at a funeral. Paisley curtains at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They laughed when they collided, their grins collided, the lies evaporated. There was only the truth between them. No more fancy stories. She was so scared, but something took over. She saw that moment. She took his hand. <p> Edward, what got into you to go and die. <p> Personal possessions : teeth, feathers, handprints in plaster, Carl 's hand when he was three, even then it was a big hand, long fingers digging eagerly into the mixture of flour and salt and water so that it did n't come out right at all. She scolded him. Imagine that! Scolding a three year old for not cooperating, when it was she who mixed up that tempting goop, seized his little hand and pressed it into the stuff, all excited and happy at the thought of the souvenir she was making. And his pleasure at the sensation and his curiosity took her by surprise, so she yelped at him. And scolded him. And saved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Of what? Of who she was, a mom wild with eagerness in her own right, making a plaster cast as if to prove to the world, I had a three year old once. Hold still, Damn it, Carl! <p> Cost of replacement : No, thanks. <p> Why did I save all these things, when the memories hurt so much? <p> Howard arrived from Juneau. His smile, soft voice, wild black hair nearly broke her heart. He was lovelier, every time she saw him. <p> Such a big, tender smile. At first he would n't let her carry anything, or drive the car, or open a door for him. <p> " Howard, " she said. " I live alone in Fairbanks, Alaska. I can open a door. " <p> But then she heard in the air, you lived alone. But look how you 've screwed up. Your house burned down! <p> He brought his suitcase into the guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, a Sony Walkman -- how silly! -- and something special, wrapped in paper. It was a red sweatshirt, with two birds -- eagles -- painted on it, in black and gold. It was beautiful. <p> " Why thank you, " she said. Feeling awkward. The birds were on their way up. Soaring up. Two big birds, covering the shirt. There was a message here, of course. Howard was her cheerleader. You can do it, mom, here you go! " Thank you, " she said. He expected her to come back to Juneau with him. " For a while, " he said. <p> They went to the remains of the house. It was her second visit. She thought she was used to it. <p> But with Howard there, it was different. While he walked delicately around the perimeter she stared at the black waffle that had once been walls, floor, living room and for just an instant she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night, when the firemen came, she felt no heat. But now, she felt it -- that oxygen-eating wall of flame. The killing smoke. And she knew if she had been home, she would have died. <p> Grace started to shake. The walls of her house had returned to what they truly were, just wood, growing in a forest, dying, disintegrating. In one night, years of human pettiness were annihilated -- never existed. Because of combustion. That 's all it took. Against that fact of the universe Grace was nothing at all. <p> She hugged herself and felt nothing but bones, ribs, a hollow rib cage. She had escaped with her life, for now, because she was n't home. Nothing here had escaped. The ground was blackened, crisp, stinking. <p> She looked at Howard, knowing that for all the horror he felt at this sight, he was also absorbing every detail. He would store it and write about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this felt. I must have been in shock until now, she thought. I could have died. Nothing is left. There is nothing here. She backed away from the site. She sat down in the car with the door open, drinking the fresh air. I was in shock, she realized. I am not now. Take notice, Grace. A fire came through here. <p> " It 's the money that really matters, " she told Howard. " I 'm having trouble with these forms. One simply loses things, that 's inevitable, but I ca n't go on without a settlement. " <p> " Let 's do it, " he said. " We can do it. Line by line this afternoon. Come on, we 'll go down to the bakery and do it there. " The poet in him knew how to buckle down to work, how to fasten himself to a chair and hold the posture till a line or two was written. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's what made him a poet. He could do it when he did n't care, because he had faith that it would make a difference. <p> Carl, on the other hand, called her from Colorado and could n't even think of anything to say. She knew he was looking out a window as he held the telephone. She did n't know why he was like that, but she understood, for an instant, the impulse. Looking out the window. Wandering off. <p> In the restaurant she could n't get up and go do something else, she could n't say to Howard, " let 's stop for now. " They faced each other across the coffee cups, the plates of food, the piles of insurance forms, and did it like two paid employees. Getting through to five o'clock. Her furniture, her appliances, her dull and standard wardrobe. But her winter clothing -- Howard was right, that was expensive, important, well-chosen. " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antiques? China? " he said. <p> " No. " <p> " None? " <p> " There was the platter we served turkey on. Remember that? And some old silk robes from Vietnam. But maybe they were n't old. Just made for the soldier boys in 1962. " <p> " Anything else? " <p> " Paints. " <p> " Paints? " " I took up painting a couple of years ago. " <p> " Well gee mom, I never knew that. " <p> " No, it was a silly thing I guess. " <p> " Paints. Oil paints? " <p> " Well... as a matter of fact, yes. A very nice set. I guess I was a little shy about it. " <p> " Well that 's terrific, morn. Let 's replace them right away. Did you have an easel? " <p> " Yes. " She put her palms around her coffee cup. " Yes, I bought a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd even finished a few. Still lifes, abstracts. It was really quite pleasant. " <p> " Did you take lessons? " <p> " No. I painted what was inside. " She touched her chest. <p> " Did you ever show them to anyone? Get any comment? ' <p> " Honey, I was a little bit embarrassed to do that. Put down -- oh, two hundred dollars, maybe. " <p> " You sure? To replace them? How about four hundred? " <p> " Okay. That 's good. Four hundred. " <p> She sat back in the booth and took a deep breath and looked out the window. There could be a point to this, after all. <p> They were on the beach at Sitka again -- that is, she was there, and Edward was there, too, but they were n't together. She was walking on the surf-pounded stones, looking down for treasures, like she always did. She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart stopped. He was advancing ; they would touch ; he was coming for her. But why was he dressed so funny, in an orange parka and a turquoise hat? He was coming toward her, though -- at last -- but then, as he neared her, he smirked. And walked by. Without any hesitation in his gait. He looked at her, and smirked. He did n't even reach through the distance between them. He laughed in recognition, and walked by. <p> She woke up stunned. <p> She flew back to Juneau with Howard. For a while the warmth and glitter of the capital city would be an entertainment. The narrow streets winding up the mountain from the harbor were full of interesting shops, even a used bookstore. <p> Howard 's wife Leah, the subject of many of his poems, taught music in a downstairs studio. She was Hungarian ; their home was so cosmopolitan, Grace always liked to explore the bookshelves, the mantel, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be something odd, something graceful, everywhere you looked -- paintings, compact discs, sculptures, water jars. Edward used to say that Leah was a hard nut to crack. Grace just reminded him that Leah came from another place. She was Hungarian ; culture, to Leah, was two thousand years old, not two hundred. <p> What Grace noticed about Leah 's house now was stuffiness. She herself wanted to be outside, on the move, walking up and down the mountain, prowling the beach. Bears were attacking garbage cans in the alleys ; they warned her to be careful, not to walk too far up the mountain, not to wander off. <p> " I 'm just going to pick up a few things to furnish my new house, " she said. " Or apartment. No, house. Yes, it 'll be a house again. I think. " <p> " Can I drive you somewhere? " asked Leah. <p> " Oh my no, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty place, " Grace insisted. " I wo n't buy anything, probably. I 'll just look. You know, Leah, losing so many things -- " <p> " Yes? " Leah held her head to the side, looked up at Grace with tenderness. Grace thought, this girl 's parents and their parents lost more than I can know, to world war, to revolution, and I 'm going to lecture her? <p> " Well, just makes you want to pause for a while, that 's all. " <p> What she had begun to say was, it makes you want to stop collecting things. Why gather up these objects and pretend they mean something? But here Leah was, the child of refugees, living out the true meaning of loss, the true and deep consequence of having nothing left. Me, Grace thought, I 'm just an old hippie, that 's what I 've become. A straight, bereft hippie. <p> She did n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she noticed the ravens. Flapping between buildings, perched on dumpsters. Big, ugly bearded creatures. They 'd flap and quork, and then go into a graceful soar that reminded her of a clown on ice skates. Somersaulting backwards over a barrel to show you how clumsy he was, how artless : then suddenly flying on one foot in a graceful spiral across the rink. As if to say, the joke 's on you now. And somehow, she thought, it is. The joke 's on all these two legged animals unable to get away from their own rubble. The ravens descend for lunch then they 're off again. But we 're here, all the time. <p> You could walk away from the boat harbor just a bit, along the beach road. Just enough for the wind to sting your face. The water, the mountains, the trees, the shrieking gulls, assailed her. Here was a life she had n't lived. A few years in Sitka, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with small children, Edward was making a living, it never occurred to her to cut them loose and explore this strange, romantic country -- all its quiet waters, all its coves, all the different sounds. God what they had missed. It was so rich here, in the Southeast, it made you cry. <p> And now she could start over. This was her chance to reinvent. To begin again. What shall I begin with? Oil paints. Real paints, and one of those painting knives you use to gouge out a lump of color and smear it onto the canvas. She knew how to frost a cake. She 'd paint the same way. <p> If she began again this life would n't be shared with Edward. <p> Would n't be shared. <p> She closed her eyes and the wind washed her cheek, a gull called, the city made its hum not far away. I am alone, alone, she thought, I am finally alone. What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do, in this emptiness. To work so hard, to coax a smile from a man. And then, in an instant, he 's in another world. He 's not in this one, any more. And you just keep sticking your fingers in the hole where he used to be. <p> Heading back to Howard 's house she passed the used bookstore. Aha ; if ever anyone had an excuse to buy books. She pushed open the door and went down a dark aisle with her hands in her pockets, furtive, defiant. She came to an alcove of art books. Remainders were piled in a tower on the floor. Nudes, coffee table books of flower prints. Dry, dull, wearisome etchings of flowers, with no background and no context at all -- just the flower hanging out there in space. That 's beautiful? I think not. <p> Here was a museum catalog. An exhibit of European ceramics. She opened this book and turned the pages. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A harlequin looked out at her from the book. Looked out at her with direct aim. His face was white, his shirt was triangles of orange and white, his pointed cap was turquoise. His knees were turned out, his heels in, one leg raised as if he was stamping on the ground. Or dancing. An ugly posture. An affront. A joke. <p> He looked at her. Where had she seen him before? People bought this thing, craved it, paid money for it, bequeathed it to a museum -- just to be accused, day after day, by this leer? Who is this creature? <p> She flattened the book out on top of the tower of remaindered picture books. She could n't take her eyes off the harlequin 's face. This, this creature, this was Edward. Yes, this was Edward. Edward, stopping in his passage to eternity to look back at her, trapped in her loneliness, in her stupidity. But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fragment of clay. A dustcatcher. <p> What is it? What do you want to tell me? <p> Her heart pressed against her breastbone ; she was suddenly filled with grief for the poor fifty-three year old widow who had lost all her belongings in a housefire just a few weeks ago. Poor thing, she thought, poor thing, and suddenly, like frosting on a cake, like sunlight touching the beach, her eyes filled with tears. <p> She walked outside and up the street, into the mountain, toward her son 's house. It 's like a joke, she thought. There 's a joke being played on me. We do n't know everything. This is a joke, and I can get it, if -- if I can do what Edward is telling me to do. The joke 's on me. The joke 's on me. I can find the crack in the world and get out of this pitiful little box of treasures. Edward, are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look -- an old lady with a wet face, talking to herself, belted into a borrowed man 's coat. Feet flat against a street so steep the backs of her calves were stretched to the fullest, climbing. " There 's where we have to go! Up there! " Edward used to call back to her, when they went hiking -- it was a joke. " Up there! Beyond that mountain! " he 'd holier, a terrycloth dishrag tucked under his baseball cap to keep the sun off his neck, so he looked like someone from Beau Geste, or Kim. <p> She would be too tired to laugh, by then. She 'd just stand there, and feel good. What would he be looking at now? She raised her eyes, to the mountains and the buildings. Look up, Grace, look where you 're going, look how lucky you are. To be seeing that. That mountain, that black bird looping about. She let her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office buildings. It swooped below the tops of the buildings, into a long, narrow gap of air, turned its head, and looked at her. Then, when only she could see, of all the people in Juneau, the raven did a mid-air rotation. Breast up to the sun. wings slicing at the earth. She almost missed it. Look what I can do. Then he was up, over the top of the building, and gone. <p> Edward, she said. <p> Her fingers curled around the handle of an imaginary painting knife. I understand, she thought. As the crow flies. Ha! We do n't know how they fly when no one 's looking. I bet they explore their element from top to bottom. They dip in and out. <p> She turned her head, then turned around in a slow circle, looking for more ravens. She walked backward up the hill, looking at the rooftops and the water beyond. They live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to. No reason not to inhabit the world. Nothing to do but live. Live. From top to bottom of my own life. A raven diving. A raven looking at you. A raven looking for a wife, for a meal, for a human being to tease. Oh! Yes! And she suddenly understood, for just a minute this first time, how many strange worlds touched her own, broke into her own, offered her the glimpse of things that would change her forever. Only look. <p> <p> By Marjorie K. Cole <p>
