1013641 Beth puts a finger over the large freckle, oddly shaped, that has always sat just below her left knee, always, so it 's a birthmark maybe, something they can use to identify her body if they ever need to, like the tiny scar below her ear. She is obsessed with this idea lately, identifying bodies, something she heard on television or else from her older brother, or someone talking. Another Beth Thomas, a new girl, has started at Beth 's school, one grade ahead of her, and already there have been mix-ups with library books and phone calls and recess games. Beth worries : if she died and her name appeared in the newspaper, nobody would know which Beth it was. We 'd use your middle name, her mother says, and Beth nods, says Elizabeth Lockwood Thomas over and over until it does n't sound like her name anymore. Her freckle is her freckle, though. She can put one finger over the brown dot below her knee and press and nothing changes. She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she sticks her legs straight out in front of her on the flat stone steps in between the warmed marigold flowerbeds, the sharp peaty smell drifting up to her as she eats a piece of white bread with peanut butter on it. She made the snack herself. She likes making her own snacks and anyway her mother is busy with the neighbor. The neighbor stopped by on her way home. The two women are inside drinking coffee, sitting on the pink couch, while the neighbor 's little boy goes in and out of the house so often they do not need to think about him until it is time to leave. <p> Beth saw it on TV : how they spread the peanut butter on the white bread and it looked so good, so smooth and deep like a thick frosting, so she makes a snack like this only without the jelly it is like eating paste. She skips past the pool to the lilac trees, climbing onto the stone wall and setting the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds will eat it. Birds like bread and they like peanut butter so they will eat it. She jumps down, both feet, Buster Brown sandals ; it is May, she loves school, she loves her mother, she lives in a house, she sees the marigolds ' sunny heads, yellow and orange, the grass is thick and new, the sky is high and blue, she skips into the house, kittens born in her mother 's closet, five kittens but one died, the mother sat on it, the mother smothered it at birth probably because there was something wrong with it, that 's what they told Beth, that 's what Beth knows, and she checks to see if their eyes have opened yet, no they have not, look at the mama cat 's nipples poking out so rudely like the dog 's pink thing, look at her dark yellow furry belly with those wet pink fingers sticking out, then in her room and out of her room and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking and talking, and then calling, calling the boy, time to go, where are you, it is time, and calling and calling. <p> Beth 's mother and the neighbor are not even very good friends. The neighbor was just driving by. She had just come from Beth 's school where she registered her boy for kindergarten for the fall. The neighbor wore a spring suit for the occasion, light green with tiny flowers on it, a skirt and blazer, a white blouse. The boy wore a sailor suit and new red Keds. The mothers drank coffee and the boy ran in and out of the house, showing them the things he had found : a stone, a feather, a leaf, a ladybug. <p> Now Beth runs outside with the mothers and they yell the little boy 's name. His name is Christopher. It 's fun calling him and the mothers ' rising voices are exciting and different ; it is a game, and also serious, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost all the places he might be-the front steps, under the willow, in his mother 's car, in the garage, in the old barn. Perhaps he is hiding from them, and Beth will be the one to find him. Then the neighbor and her son can go home and Beth can have her mother all to herself again. <p> From the patio Beth sees her brother walking along the road with his friend, carrying something. She yells to her mother, here comes Greg, he 's got something. They think for a second, Beth and the mothers, that maybe he is carrying Christopher, that maybe that is the answer, even though it makes no sense, even though if he were carrying the boy in that position it would mean the boy was hurt, and Greg would be walking faster or running or behaving in some other alarmed way and he is not. They yell to him, Greg, Greg, have you seen Christopher? He is confused, No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hears what is in their voices. He is carrying a sleeping bag that he left at his friend 's house, a green sleeping bag with a red flannel lining. <p> Then it occurs to them, finally, where they must look. <p> He is at the bottom. He is in the deep end. <p> It is a spot that Beth will never forget, that one spot in the deep end. He was maybe playing with a net which is floating in the water, he dropped the net and was trying to get it. People talked about this later, what must have happened, why he was near the pool, they had told him, they had warned him, also he knew how to swim, also he had been such a good swimmer last summer at the lake, also he swam even better than his older sister, also he had been a little fish last summer, also he was just in the house he was just here, also. <p> The mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are screaming. <p> Beth 's mother cries, Greg, get him, see if you can get him. <p> Greg jumps in with all his clothes on. He tries swimming to the bottom of the deep end. He comes up once and goes down again. He is twelve. He is a good swimmer but he is twelve and when he gets to the bottom he does not have enough air to lift the boy and carry him to the surface. He tries. The boy is at the bottom. Greg comes up again. I ca n't get him, Greg says. I ca n't get him. He swims to the side. He climbs out of the pool. It is a bright day, the sun shining on Greg 's wet brown hair. The cement around the pool underneath Beth 's bare feet is warm. The neighbor takes off her black pumps, jumps in, in her green suit. She goes right to the bottom. She swims right down there and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side and Beth 's mother takes him. She lays him down on the cement. How long has he been there. Oh my God how long has he been down there. Greg and his friend Louis and Beth stand by the pool but not too close to the mothers, no, on the other side of where the mothers are. Beth 's mother puts her mouth on Christopher 's mouth. She opens his small mouth and blows into his mouth and in between blows she is saying Oh God. She can not take the time to tell Beth to go play now, to tell Greg and Louis to take Beth inside, turn on the TV, something. <p> That 's what he ate for lunch, the neighbor is crying, the water and soggy bread crusts gushing from the boy 's mouth and the boy does not look like the boy, eyes closed, face tight, hair plastered down, clothes plastered down, wet skin shining, limbs spread, vomit and water. Call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house and call the ambulance, and the neighbor in her wet green suit and her stockings and her wet hair runs into the house and calls. <p> The boy just lies there. <p> The neighbor comes back outside. I do n't think I gave them the address, the neighbor cries, the street but I do n't know the number. Beth 's mother sends Beth and Greg to the front yard. Go wait for the ambulance, tell them where we are, wait on the front steps. Louis runs home. Greg and Beth wait, they walk up and down the stone path, it 'll be okay do n't you think it 'll be okay, they 'll fix him at the hospital, they have machines also in the ambulance when the ambulance comes the men will put him on a stretcher and they have machines inside the ambulance that can make him better. They have oxygen and shots they can give him. Greg tells Beth these things, explains to her how it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait, Greg 's arms and legs goosefleshy in the breeze, wet threads from his cut-offs clinging white against his leg, the maple trees making spotty shadows on his dark T-shirt. Beth is glad to stand with her brother who usually does n't come out here with her on the front steps where she likes to watch cars go by or kids on bikes. She thinks of Christopher 's house just down the street, a big yellow house with lots of yard and woods all around and a barn and even two horses. That house is probably empty right now because Christopher 's sister is playing at a friend 's house, and the father is at work, and everyone else from that family is here, in Beth 's backyard. <p> It takes a long time for the ambulance to come. It feels like a very long time. Beth wonders what her mother is doing now. She wonders what Christopher is doing, if he is still throwing up or if he has stopped. <p> Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave at it as if they are on a deserted island and this is the ship that has finally sailed into view. They run ahead to the backyard to show the men where to go. The men are carrying bags and things and run clumsily. Greg and Beth wait on the patio. Everything takes a long time. Beth thought they 'd just take him right away. The mothers maybe could have gotten him to the hospital by now. If they 'd put him in the car. But the hospital is a ways away. Twenty minutes, maybe. Beth has seen it : a big brick building on a hill. They wait. After a long time the mothers run across the grass. Their faces. <p> Greg, take Beth to Louis 's, Beth 's mother says. <p> The mothers ride with Christopher to the hospital. Greg and Beth walk to Louis 's house. Louis 's mother has a gold tooth and brown worried eyes and wears a blue housecoat and speaks in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bald rather wears a dark green uniform like the gas station man, his name sewn over one pocket in red cursive. Beth watches Superman on the black-and-white TV. Louis 's mother keeps adjusting the antenna. She brings Beth food, peanut butter and marshmallow fluff sandwiches, which is something her mother never makes. The house smells of cooking. The house feels small and dirty. Beth has never been here before. Greg disappears with Louis. She does n't know where they go or what she 's supposed to do. She eats half of the sandwich but it makes her feel sick. Louis 's mother wrings her hands and frets and keeps looking out the window. Beth does n't want to be rude, but she can not eat the sandwich. <p> That night Beth 's father comes home. He does n't always come home. He stays in the apartment they have rented in Midtown. He is mostly away on a trip, or he works late, he is working on a film, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final stages of the film and must work late and stay at the apartment. When he does come home, he takes the train from Grand Central for an hour and a half and then drives another twenty minutes from Brewster then gets up in the morning at six to do the whole thing over again. Beth 's mother talks to him on the phone at night. Dinner plates are covered in foil and kept warm in the oven and then eventually, after the phone call, moved into the refrigerator. The plates are white with little blue swirls around the edges like commas. Sometimes the food is thrown away and the plate is washed and dried and put back in the cabinet. <p> This night, he comes home. <p> Beth does not sleep in her bed on this night. She sleeps on the couch. The couch where the mothers were sitting. She sleeps here with the throw covering her. The parents are talking. They think she is asleep but she is n't asleep. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. The room is dark. Her mother is sitting in the wing chair by the window. Her father is sitting in the tub chair across the room. He is smoking a Pall Mall from the red pack and drinking scotch from his glass. Beth can peek at them because they think she is asleep and anyway they are not thinking about her right now. Her mother is weeping. <p> I 'll never forget seeing his little head, she cries. I thought it was a football. <p> Her father 's eyes are rimmed with red and he drops his head back, looks at the ceiling. All this is happening but Beth is on the couch and her mother and father are there so maybe it is okay after all. No one has said what happened, after the ambulance. No one has said what happened in the hospital. <p> The conversation is a soft murmur now, a few words, then quiet, then a few more words, like intermittent rain, a drop here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is the last night she hears her parents talk about it. They ca n't talk about it. The grown-ups ca n't. They do n't know how to talk about it or else they talk about it when Beth is n't there or else they have sworn to each other never to say anything about it again. <p> Beth 's best friend calls her. Her friend lives in the city. When Beth visits her there, they sit in the bedroom and look out the window at the prostitutes, seven floors below, standing on the corner of Eighth Avenue. They play kickball in the hallway, with other people 's doors as the bases. No one ever complains. The halls there smell of cats and when they buy ice cream cones at Mr. Custard 's, the ice cream is sprinkled with tiny black specks like finely ground pepper by the time they get home. Soot, her friend says. <p> Pray to God, her friend says now. Pray for Christopher to come back. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you pray hard enough, God will bring Christopher back. You just have to pray really really hard. You just have to really believe and it will happen. Neither Beth nor her friend has ever actually gone to church or been schooled in the ways of faith, but now her friend is fervent and sure. Beth listens to her voice on the other end. She presses the phone to her ear. She imagines her friend sitting in her apartment, cross-legged on the couch. She has not seen the thing Beth has seen. She has no idea. <p> At school, in line waiting for the bus, Denise Grassio whom everyone calls Denise Grassy Ass tells Beth what Christopher 's sister has been saying, all day. For a moment Beth ca n't breathe. She looks straight ahead, the cinder block walls, Gordon Jensen 's ugly square head, someone 's Flintstones lunchbox. Her whole body goes hot and tingly, like when they make you put your coat on in the winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you have to stand in the hot corridor waiting, hat and mittens and scarves and the heat between your body and your clothes rising like bath water. Why would Christopher 's sister say this thing? She sees herself on that day. How she checked the kittens, how she walked outside with the bread and peanut butter, the smell of like, the bright sky. How she put the bread in the tree and climbed down from the stone wall and went inside. Then the mothers could n't find him. Then she helped them look for him. Then they found him. But Christopher 's sister is saying, she has been telling everyone in the entire school <p> She says you pushed him in. <p> Denise is still looking at her. Beth finally shakes her head. I did not, she says, as if she is fighting with Greg about some little thing, a lost G. I. Joe or a scratched record. The buses come. They line up, the usual row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number is eleven. Number eleven is called and her line inches forward. Denise is in a different line and her line does n't move. Airs. Flynn, the bus driver, sits in her seat, her sleeves pushed up her big arms. Last year Mrs. Flynn gave Beth a rhinestone pin in the shape of a ballerina that Beth keeps in her jewelry box. Beth climbs the bus steps, legs tired. <p> Hey, sweetie, Mrs. Flynn says. How 's your day been? <p> Okay, Beth says. She takes the first seat, right behind Mrs. Flynn, so that Mrs. Flynn can keep an eye on her. <p> Outside : parking lot, grass, trees, cloud, sky, sky. <p> Author Affiliation
