1002241 1002241	 Mary 's Freezer <p> Sunday, I helped Mary clean the freezer. When I arrived, her door was locked and she was peeping through the round windows. Inside, we visited, sharing moose hunting stories, summer camping stories. <p> Mary remembers going moose hunting near Aishihik. Her husband killed a moose. Then she saw two rabbits hanging by the fire, all skinned out, ready to cook. <p> " But I never say nothing, " she said. Finally her husband pointed them out, and then she said, " I just run to get them. " She had mentioned how he would n't snare rabbits for her, and then there were those two rabbits. She also remembers camping at Little Salmon Lake, and fishing and fishing, and catching only one small fish. <p> " I just fry it up quick, " she said. <p> Then, we turn to the freezer. Inside there is meat wrapped in brown paper bags, frozen ice packs for camping, a moose scapula, cans for saving moose fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't bend over, me, " Mary said. " I asked that Kluane 's daughter who lives across there, but she 's got school work. " <p> I lilt food onto the counter until the freezer is almost empty. At the bottom, a few berries roll around on blood-stained cardboard. I unplug the freezer, then Mary plugs in the tea kettle and sets it down inside the freezer. <p> " My daughter showed me that, " she says. " At first, I do n't believe her. I said you ca n't do it! ' " she laughs. <p> We wait for the ice to drop from the sides of the freezer, a large aluminum bowl sits ready to catch it. We talk and the smell of cooking beef ribs and potatoes fills the small kitchen. Mary shuffles around in her worn pink slippers and yellow sleeveless blouse, with buttons straining. <p> After a few minutes, we open the lid to the freezer and ice fog rises like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zero. I pry ice from the side of the freezer with my fingers. It falls cleanly as the steam works. We talk of the bush. Watson Lake, Little Atlin Lake, places Mary has hunted, camped, lived. I throw the ice into the sink and Mary runs hot water over it. At last only water is left and ice debris. Mary carefully takes a box of baking soda encased in a plastic bag from the cupboard and sprinkles some into the large aluminum bowl, then adds warm water. I bend down into the freezer and begin soaking up the water with a green and white checked tea towel. When everything is dry we put the bags of food back. <p> Mary has a system. She searches through the bags. Fish in one corner, moose ribs in another. <p> " Where are those gophers? " she asks herself. <p> I look, and there at the top of a bag is a package of small animals, their pawless legs thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say. <p> " Oh, " she says, in a satisfied tone. " They go here. " <p> We move and juggle bags to meet her system, then close the lid of the freezer. I put the plug into the wall socket, it hums, and we sit down to supper. The ribs are brown and tender, the bare potatoes baked in beef juices. Mary deftly cuts the meat from the bone and sprinkles it with salt. I struggle with mine, embarrassed to leave meat. Her bones are bare and clean. <p> " I ate some fat, " she says, shaking her head in disapproval. " Just one piece, that kind. " Then drinks her tea. <p> After, I walk home. The clay cliffs are brown in the autumn evening. Juncos fly through the grass near Mary 's door. <p> Article copyright Yukon Status of Women Council. <p> Article copyright Yukon Status of Women Council. <p>
