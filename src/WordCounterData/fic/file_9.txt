1001241 PH.D. IN CONSTRUCTION. Lorne is a good carpenter, catches the foreman 's mistakes, knows what 's coming next. One day he finds out that I have a university degree. We stop work for a moment while he pulls out the blue bandanna he stores like a good luck token in his left back pocket. As he rubs the back of his neck Lorne eyes the wall we are building and approves. I am a professional, he announces. I 've built office towers, pulp mills, dams. Spent four years studying, apprentice to a carpenter, same as your Bachelor of Science and twenty-six more perfecting my hand. You could say I have a Ph.D. in construction. I am only a third year apprentice. For the rest of the job I call him Doctor Lorne. Article copyright Tradeswomen, Inc. Article copyright Tradeswomen, Inc.
