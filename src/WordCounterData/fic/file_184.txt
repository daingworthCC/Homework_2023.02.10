4081841 He entered her sleeping mind with an unexpected thrust of force. But he should not have been surprised by her resistance. She always resisted sleeping, it seemed, as if she did n't have time for it and wished she could do away with the restful state completely. Not that it was going to be restful now that he was there. At the moment there was no cohesion to the visions in her mind, the things surrounding him merely remnants of the electrical impulses and memories of things from the boring waking world in which she lived. He did n't understand why anyone would want to wake up. The worlds of the mind were so vast and creative and could keep a person entertained forever. Of course, they could also torment them endlessly, he conceded with a private little smile to himself. The emotion-evoking land of nightmares could range from simple guilt and self-induced fears to the roaring dramatics of beasts and the running from or falling to certain death. The latter was a somewhat lazy method, he felt. It took the finesse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his subject in such a way as to turn every part of her own psyche into an antenna of fear, emitting the emotion in powerful, satiating waves of energy. Energy he needed. Energy he craved. He found her at the very center of her mind, the exhausted need for sleep having forced her under, and her uncooperative imagination was simply tossing up flickering images of a sick girl in bed or her father 's robust laugh. " No, no, this will not do at all, " he murmured. He painted their surroundings in perfect pitch of night, the sparkle of stars above and below them as if they were flying among them. She was, as yet, unaware of him, but she responded to the change in her surroundings with awe and wonderment. Her heart raced at being unsure of her footing. Physics and reality were suspended, but her mind had a hard time accepting that. When a subject first began to dream, the person was only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a head-to-toe body stocking, the subject had no color, no hair, no skin or bone. Just the semiformed black mannequin the subject 's perspective allowed for at first. But depending on the nature of the dream, that would quickly change. The heavy and encumbered could become thin and spry, the ugly could become beautiful, and the beautiful could become plain ; all according to the subconscious needs of the dreamer at hand. But what he liked about this particular woman was that she never once altered her base appearance. The moment she began to dream with him, the blackness would melt away, giving shape to her tall frame with its wickedly long legs and the wide expanse of hips that filled out every outfit she wore with such a nicely pronounced curvature that led to an equally delectable backside. She was busty as well, every movement making her curve in one way or another. Her face was something else, though, aristocratic and elegantly planed, the look of a stern but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ponytail she kept the incredible length of her chestnut hair in or it was her gray eyes that made her seem so severe at first, but then she would smile or cry and it would all change. Or she would become gloriously angry and her beauty would truly explode. He was convinced that this was the way she looked in the waking world. There was never any variation and, in his opinion, there was hardly any need for it. The changes in her appearance came later, by his hand, when it suited his mood, and it was rarely anything more dramatic than the nature of her clothing. Tonight she was flying and her usual jeans and T-shirt were unacceptable. With a thought he dropped a long white gown over her head, the simple silk flowing from shoulders to toes, outlining the curved perfection of her body, clinging to the beauty of her breasts and their outthrust nipples. She liked the gift, the pleasure clear on her lovely face, and he could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. They had so little time together, and...... and there were rules he must follow. Shapeless and dark, he thrust himself up against her from behind, his arm ringing her shoulders and his brute 's body like a solid wall of muscle and masculinity against her. She startled, her hands immediately going to the arm that held her so tightly. She did n't call out a name, telling him that she did n't have any notable men in her life whom she felt would come up on her like this. Why the idea should please him, he did n't know. Nor did he care. He wrapped his hand around her neck, the delicate length of her throat so unexpectedly narrow compared to the rest of her voluptuous body that he had a moment of fear that he had grabbed her too hard. Then he laughed at himself because it was only a dream, and grabbing her too hard was a part of the nightmare to come. He could see into her mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her life... and most of all, every fear she had ever had. It impressed him that she did not have very many things that scared her. She was as tough as she was beautiful. But everyone had fears no matter how tough a person was, and she was no exception. He merely enjoyed the challenge for what it was. She began to struggle against him in earnest, her feet and legs flailing as she tried to kick him. But she could n't hurt him here in this place. Not really. Enjoying how she fought him, he threw her down on the bed that suddenly appeared. He followed over her, a dark hulking figure she could not make out or fight off no matter how hard she tried. She gritted her teeth in frustration, and he simply held her there, trapped and immobile. " Who are you? What do you want? " she wanted to know. Then he paid great attention to the details of her trapped body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed. As far as jobs went, this was n't the worst one to have. " You tell me first, " he taunted her, his voice like gravel and sand. " Obey me or you will not like the consequences. " She thought about it, the stubborn set of her lips telling him she 'd rather get her teeth pulled than tell him anything, but in the end her psychological make-up was going to defeat her. " Kathryn, " she spat out. Kathryn. Oh, how he loved to hear her name. He asked her for it every time, just to hear that defiant burst of passionate declaration. In the first three or four dreams he had n't asked for her name, not wanting to attach himself to her too personally, perhaps knowing on some level that there was a danger of it with this creature that was not present in others. Now he knew, and he could not take back the knowing. And he did n't want to. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as bold and glorious as she was. She was, he thought heatedly, a one-of-a-kind and most perfect thing. He rose over her, relieving her of the burden of his weight as he hovered above her. She might not be able to make his features out, but her mind would interpret his menacing and covetous expression as he ran his eyes over her stretched-out body. He reached to hold her hands above her head in one of his, then raked a hard hand and curved fingers down over her face, throat, and chest. " You always fight, " he growled, and his harsh hand yanked up the gown and exposed her legs all the way to her thighs. The movement was such a hard one that she shimmied in all of her softest places, emphasizing just how much of a woman she really was. " But I know what you really want, " he told her as his hand scorched up over her thigh and his palm briefly cupped her bare sex. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him, only succeeding in opening herself to him. After all, as far as struggles went, this one was quite mild. Perhaps she was beginning to remember the game. Perhaps she was becoming too complacent. " So, you have no desire to fight? " he asked her hotly, his breath coming quick even though she was being too easy. Just being this close to her stirred him to distraction. " Where is your fear? " As he said it everything around the room exploded into flames. The only thing left untouched was the bed, but the heat felt all too real and dangerous. Kathryn cried out, struggling harder now to get out from under him, to get away from the thing she feared the most. He could feel her heart racing ; she was panting hard for her breath. He tore at the top of her gown, exposing her to the waist, pulling her breast out to meet his mouth. When she screamed it was with a splendid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion as to why she would react in such a way. But he knew her mind far better than she did, and knew that the excitement of a forcible seduction was one of her darkest fantasies, one she would only ever indulge in here, where it was safe. The fear of the fire only heightened the adrenaline coursing through her. The more intense the danger, the more excited she became. But still the key element was in her resistance to herself. She felt how she responded and thought it was wrong. She felt shame and guilt, like something was defective within her because she grew wet as he gnawed and devoured her nipple over and over again. He wished then that he could truly taste her skin, truly smell the scent of her. He wanted her in real dimensions, not these imaginary ones. He shifted up to crush his mouth upon hers, the full perfection of her mouth calling to him incessantly, day and night, with no quiet to be had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great passion but could experience none of the depth and flavor of her. He knew she could feel his passionate intentions, but he was just outside of truth of definition to her as well. With a roar of fury he burst away from the bed and the object of his dissatisfaction. Ever since he had stumbled upon her the first time, he had been utterly obsessed. He 'd tried time and again to stop, to carry on his work elsewhere, to fill his time with better sources of fear and focus. But always she lured him back, with her infuriating perfection and needful body. She craved so many dark and wonderful things ; she had the deepest of fears and yet faced them with such unbelievable courage. She was utterly fascinating. And he wanted her. Not just in this realm he was limited to, but beyond it. In the real. He would take her-yes! Yes, he could keep her then, keep her for his very own, and no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him. He reached out for her, pulling her to her feet and into the fire. Her dress immediately caught flame at the hem and she screamed, struggling to brush away the flames. " Tell me where you live and I 'll make it all stop, " he promised her. " Stop it! Please! " " Tell me, " he coaxed her as the flames leapt higher against her. Drowning in terror and flame, she did. Ripping out of the horrifying nightmare with a gasp, Kathryn instantly tried to beat out flames that no longer existed. Her sudden movement nearly toppled her out of the plain wooden chair she 'd pulled up to her sister 's bedside. It took her a moment to shake off her disorientation, to realize she had fallen asleep while watching over Jillian. She hurriedly left her chair to lean over her sister 's bed. Jillian was shivering weakly, her breath rasping in a sickening staccato rhythm. " Hush, now. Rest, love, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbed the grit of weariness from her eyes as she turned to the bedside table. It took her a moment to focus on the paraphernalia there. There were bottles of medicine, a thermometer, and a large china basin with rags soaking in water and melting ice. The bottle labels were a confusion to her for a moment as she tried to get a grasp on her weary concentration. Then she found what she was looking for. She tumbled two small aspirin from one bottle into her palm, hoping to keep Jillian 's fever down. Then Kathryn grabbed a glass of cool water and turned back to Jillian, maneuvering herself behind the frail ten-year-old 's head and lifting it until she could manage to wrangle the medicine down the child 's throat. Jillian accepted the pills well enough for someone who had occasionally been too weak to swallow, and it gave Kathryn a glimmer of hope. What she would n't give for the simplicity of children 's liquid medicine right then. But in the bush of Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies, and the colorful syrup had run out a while back. " There now, what a good girl you are, " she praised Jillian softly, stubbornly believing that the child could somehow hear her. She spent a moment stroking her sister 's thin, pale red hair. Then she slid gingerly from the bed. Kathryn waited anxiously for several minutes until she was certain the child had quieted again and was resting as peacefully as she could. Then she straightened stiffly, her hands pressing into the aching curve of her lower back. She looked at her watch, trying to determine what day it was as well as the time. She had called for help almost twenty-four hours ago, but things took time out in the bush. But it should be soon. Hopefully very soon. Kathryn felt her exhaustion with sudden acuteness. Dizziness washed through her and she touched fingertips to her forehead in an attempt to steady herself and her swaying vision. " Father, " she prayed fiercely, " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a harsher wave of vertigo spilled over her. Kathryn... Kathryn gasped softly when the low, thick whisper reached her ears. She whirled around drunkenly, taking in the madly tilting room to see who had spoken her name. A macabre chill rushed her flesh. " Papa? " she asked breathlessly, widening her eyes in an attempt to focus. But no one was there but her and Jillian. Kathryn reached to grasp one of the spiraling bedposts, clinging to it as she searched herself for a store of strength she might not yet have tapped. There was none. Kathryn fought back tears. She must find the strength! Somehow. She was the only one left for her desperately ill family to depend on. She waited, breathing deeply, for the room to stop pitching and rolling around her. She dared not close her eyes. She would surely succumb to the persistent, lurking need to sleep that had harried her every step these last days. She simply did not have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever she did fall asleep, there was nothing there for her but terrible and disturbing dreams. Sometimes, like before, all-out nightmares. Slowly the room righted itself, becoming once again the firm, solidly built expanse of sturdy antique furnishings it had always been. Taking another deep breath, Kathryn took a moment to tuck a straggling tendril of hair back behind her ear. She slipped a palm against her slightly rounded stomach, wishing it would settle as the room had. She could n't remember the last time she 'd eaten anything, but it seemed very unimportant when the lives of her family were at risk. Then she took the firmest steps she could manage to the door. She was halfway along the hallway when her vision blurred again and the floor fell away with sickening speed. She collapsed to her knees and hands, jarring her joints as she realized the floor was still very much where it was supposed to be, it was merely her head and her vision leaving much to be desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she commanded herself fiercely. " You 're the daughter of Connor Macdonough, the granddaughter of Fiona Macdonough. You shame the Macdonough name if you quit now! " Somehow, after this empowering speech, she managed to drag herself back up to her feet, using the wall as her main support. She slid herself along it so that she could tell right from left and up from down while using it for the stability her betraying eyes would not provide. She finally reached her father 's door. " Kathryn. " The whisper was louder this time. Nearer. She convinced herself that it had been her father after all, even though it sounded nothing like him. But the sickness could very easily have put that rough, mournful lilt into his words... could n't it?( Continues...)
