1002841 Incarnation <p> Last Saturday, Jera Sykes <p> And I hiked out to our <p> Favorite grove in Goshen. <p> We went exploring to see <p> What spring was all about <p> This year. A new squirrel <p> nest settled in the big <p> Pine and more lemon balm <p> Pushing up by the stand <p> Of oak trees. I watched her <p> Hunker down and grind her buckknife <p> In the soil... She talked of <p> Her prior life on a Budapest farm. <p> " Little hands and feet helped <p> Me climb the old fruit tree. <p> There I sat, gorging on <p> Dark berries, with round eyes <p> And belly, watching the <p> Hen 's blood soak into mud. <p> Then the hen disappeared <p> Into the barn with Papa <p> Leaving nothing but feathers <p> And the sound of farm animals <p> praying. <p> Article copyright Men 's Resource Center of Western Massachusetts <p> Article copyright Men 's Resource Center of Western Massachusetts <p>
