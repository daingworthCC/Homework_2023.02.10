4052341 Forum ; Lawns and Gardens Thread : Help needed!!!! User Garden Warrior I 've got moles. User : dermatolojest Do n't worry unless they start to grow weird lumps. <Link : **35;0;TOOLONG User : Garden Warrior Ha-ha. They 're eating my lawn. User : biocbick ' 03 No they 're not. Moles eat grubs and earthworms. They 're just tunneling. User : Garden Warrior Same difference. What do you do about them? User : dnttellmymm Get a cat? User : simpleguy38304 Better be a big damn cat. You ever seen the claws on those things? <Link : Mole pics> User : Hypermutt27 A dog works. Though it can do more damage dun the moles. User : Farmer John X I had a dog that went after a raccoon once. The ' coon damn near won. Those tilings drag dogs off into creeks and drown ' em. User : biochick ' 03 That 's an old wives ' tale. Or whatever 's the farmer equivalent. User : Farmer John X Tell it to my dog. The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the coon with a garden hoe, but I missed and got the dog. $300 in stitches, and he still answers to " Zipperhead. " Must have concussed him, too. Not that he was all dut bright to begin with. User : Garden Warrior OK, but what do I really do? User : transportolojest Move? User : Farmer John X Mole traps. A bit bloody, but they work. They 've got a spike that snaps down when the mole goes through its tunnel. AU you Ve got to do is figure out their main thoroughfares and it 's shish-kebob rodent. User : biochick ' 03 Moles are n't rodents. :) User : Garden Warrior And there 's been no sign of new activity. I think they only went through once, a couple of days ago. User : biochick ' 03 So what 's the problem? Just stomp down the grass and forget it. The grass 'll do just fine, though you might not want to play croquet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they come back? And I guess I 'm curious. Where did they come from? User : biolojest Where does anything come from? <Link : A Parent 's Guide to Gulden 's Questions About Sex> User : Garden Warrior Seriously guys. I 've never had moles before. Then a whole crop of them went through a couple of nights ago. User : linguijest Crop? User : Garden Warrior What do moles come in? Phalanxes? Droves? You know how the veins pop up on the back of your hand when you hold it at your side? Well, that was my lawn, except they 're all running the same direction, like rays from the sun. User : biochick ' 03 And you 've never had moles before? You must have done something to attract those beeties they like. Did you over-water or use too much fertilizer? I do n't know what moles come in. I bet it starts with " m. " Mobs? User : Garden Warrior I did n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You probably heard about that. User : astroman-Fort. Worth Holy cow( or whatever theyll let me say on tiiis board) are you in Gilroy Center? User : Garden Warrior Yeah. Only it did n't really Wt the town, like they reported. It was down by the river, where nobody Uves. Right in the middle of the night. I thought it was a thunderbolt. The flash can be so bright it wakes you a half-second before the bang, even though your eyes are closed. Kind of exciting, once you peel yourself off the ceiling. This was like that only not quite so cool. It kind of sizzled as it went overhead. Very weird. User : mister12 A drunk Wt a telephone pole across from my house once. Big bang. Harsh blue light, sparks everywhere. Fried my TV and microwave. Made me a big believer in surge protectors. User : Garden Warrior Yeah, it was like that, but without the sparks. Folks from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but could n't find any. Eventually, they concluded it must have been a big piece of ice that melted when it hit There was water in the crater, but hey, down near the river any hole is going to turn into a puddle, so if it was spacewater or groundwater, who 'd know? So they gave up and went home. A couple of weeks later, the water drained away and the hole filled in. User : astroman-Fort. Worth That 's when the moles came? User : Garden Warrior Yeah. You know, now that I think about it, the tracks run in that direction. Do you think they were going toward it or away? User : astroman-Fort. Worth Away. I bet there was a nasty chemical in that ice. Cyanide or something. Cyanide 's common in comets and interstellar space. Something poisonous, anyway. Living underground maybe they 're more sensitive to it than you and me. User Garden Warrior So why did n't die sdentists find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking. They were hunting for meteorite chunks, right? Maybe diey found something and wrote it off as a chemical dump. My granddad was a farmer, and you would n't believe the things he tossed in die back forty. I bet diere are thousands of farms with old trash heaps dut would be Superfund sites if anyone knew about diem. User Farmer John X Cheery thought. User radiolojest Well, if your moles start to glow in die dark at least it 'll be easier to find diem. User Garden Warrior OK, so I went out to stomp down the mole tracks but it did n't work. User Farmer John X What do you mean, " did n't work "? User Garden Warrior I mean I could n't stomp diem down. There 's something firm down below, like concrete or steel. User biodiickO3 Did it turn really dry or something? Maybe the dirt 's hardened. Though diat 's hard to imagine in... where 's Gilroy Center? Iowa? User @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawn 's baked to concrete. I 'm going to get a shovel and see what 's down diere. Back in a sec. User biochick ' 03 That 's really weird. Moles churn up the soil. It should be softer, not harder. User biocbick 03 Garden Warrior? You still diere? You 've been offline a long time just for digging a hole. User biochick ' 03 Garden Warrior? Yoo-hoo. Did they have another thunderstorm in Iowa or something? Did he lose power? User dnttellmymm Nope. The weather 's been fine. <Link : Weather map> User biochick ' 03 So where is he? User Garden Warrior Sorry guys. I had to hunt up a camera so I could show you what I 'd found. <Link : photos> As far as I can teU, these tubes are in all the tracks. Wherever I dug, anyway, and my backyard now looks like hypermutt 's dog 's been after it. How big is a mole, anyway? These tilings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm the closest property to the river, though the crater 's a ways away. BTW, they come from that direction and seem to run fairly dose to the surface until they hit the street beyond me. Then they dive down and do n't come back up. At least diere are no tracks in the lawn across the street or anywhere else I looked, though I only got a few blocks away. User dnttettmymm Those sure ai n't no moles. Moles are n't that big. Not to mention not lining their tunnels with steel. User Garden Warrior Not steel. More like really hard ceramic. like drain tile, only bigger. User simpleguy38304 So, uh, how straight and uniform are these tubules? User Garden Warrior They seem pretty consistent. They bend a bit around trees and my house, but there are n't any kinks, U that 's what you mean. User simpleguy38304 Do you think they 're hollow, or solid like roots? User Garden Warrior Definitely hoUow. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back out and take another look. User biochick ' 03 Be careful. User dnttellmymm Of what? User biodiick ' 03 I do n't know. When was the last time you had instant pipes in your backyard? IJS, I 'm kind of glad I 'm in Hawaii. We 've got our ecological problems - do n't ask about the idiots who brought in pigs, rats, and snakes- but at feast any kind of tunneling critter is going to have to get beneath a big, deep ocean to get here on its own. Sometimes being stuck on an island gives you island fever. Sometimes it 's reassuring. User ecolojest Well if pigs had wings they would n't need us to get to Hawaii. So maybe when moles have snorkels? Sorry, there 's a joke in there somewhere ; I just ca n't quite find it. Got ta ' get to work, anyway. User biochick ' 03 YOU have a job? User survivolojest Yeah, pretty boring but I 'm addicted to calories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all dut. Happy mole hunting. User simpleguy38304 Oh ****. Oh ****. Oh ****, ****. Oh double****, this site 's auto-censoring me. What can I say? ****. Guess not. Crap. That 's too mud but at least it 's still ****ing there. Who the ****ing **** wrote this software, anyway? User dnttellmymm Hint : try English, not Anglo-Saxon. What the " **** " are you trying to say? User simpleguy38304 Have you seen the ' ****ing news? This is bad. Very bad. User dnttellmymm English! English! User biocbickO3 Never mind, check diis out -clink : Sewer Gas Afflicts Iowa Town> " Experts baffled, " they say. But then they add : " Strange fumes are emanating from sewers in the rural Iowa town of Gttroy Center. Nobody is sure what the gas is, but dozens, maybe more, have collapsed on city streets, dead or unconscious. " <Link : Video> And if you play the video, you 'll see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't moved since. Where are you Garden Warrior? Gd out of diere, now! User dnttellmymm Maybe he figured it out and ran. User simpleguy38304 Or did n't and did n't. It looks like it 's spreading. The news-copters are finding bodies on neighboring farms. Not just people but livestock. User biocbick 03 This is unreal. People do n't the on message boards. User Garden Warrior Hey folks, sorry to scare you. So far, my side of town 's unaffected. My neighbors are all trying to drive away, but the way out starts by going downtown, so if you 're into praying, you might give it a try. My sister keeps calling. Hall the time she wants me to make a run for it. The other half she wants me to stay put Any of you got any ideas on that? I 'm on Eustace Drive, which is a cul-de-sac, cut off by the river. It 's northeast of town and while there 's not much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I might not have much time. User astroman-Fort. Worth Got it. WebMaps is great. Do you drive a blue hatchback? User Garden Warrior Not any longer. Those satmaps were probably made a year ago. User simpleguy38304 Good thing, I guess. Who 'd want to see all those bothes. Oh, hell, they 're probably friends of yours. Sorry about that. For what it 's worth, the news says a lot of folks got away at least those who made up their minds fast. User astroman-Fort. Worth Give me a moment. GIS was my minor in college. It 's amazing what you can do with WebMaps if you know how. User astroman-Fort. Worth OK, IVe got two factoids. First, I would n't try to drive out. The death zone definitely cuts all of the roads, so if that gas is still there in sufficient concentration, you 'd need a HazMat suit to get through. But if you want to swim the river and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. As best I can teU, the gas is expanding westward, even though that 's upwind. I 'd guess that means the pipes are continuing to grow in that direction. Presuming, of course, that this and your pipes are related. User Garden Warrior They are. When I was out a few minutes ago, the pipes were making this hissing sound. I put an ear to one and it was really obvious. Then I got a sledgehammer and tried to break into it. <emoticon : shudder> Luckily, whatever they 're made of is really tough. So it 's not drifting my way? User astroman-Fort. Worth Not at the moment. There 's probably not yet enough to make a big, toxic plume. " Yet " being the operative word. User simpleguy38304 That 's it. Reassure him. Nice job, astro. User. Garden Warrior No, that 's OK In the basement, IVe got an old gas mask I bought years ago for Halloween. I also used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though we do n't have much air pollution in Iowa. Back then, it actually worked : at least, it took out the exhaust from the tractor pulling our float. And yeah, even then that seemed ironic... the tractor, that is. Maybe the damn thing still works. If I can find it. Back in a sec. User dnttellmymm We 've heard dut before. Maybe you should try the river. User astroman-Fort. Worth He 'll be back. The gas is still fanning west. They 're getting cases now as far as five miles out. Though nobody else is talking about pipes. When they hit Garden Warrior 's street, they must have dived deep and stayed there. Do you think those things learn? User survivolojest Most likely " thing, " not " things. " User biochick ' 03 Hey, joker-nun, you 're back! User survivolojest-bill Yeah. I saw the news. My real name 's William, BTW UGW makes it through, we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a lot more than GWs survival that 's on the Une. They 're seeing dead cows seven mUes out. Do you think this thing 's building new hubs? User biochick ' 03 Would n't surprise me. What is it? An alien invasion? User astroman-Fort. Worth For all we know, it 's space kudzu. Maybe you really are safe out in Hawaii, biochick. User simpleguy 38304 I would n't count on it. I bet when it gets bigger it can go deeper. User misteri 2 Maybe it 's some kind of nanotechnology. A terraforming gadget and we 're the terra to be formed. User geolojest-bill Would n't that be " astroforming? " Sony. Old habits... Anyway, it 's staying underground, at least for the moment. What does n't it like on the surface? The sun? Wind? Ram? Air? Us? User astroman-Fort. Worth Whatever this thing is, it 's killing plants as well as people, -clink : AP photos> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targets? What would aliens- nanotech, space kudzu, or little green man - probably see as the most toxic gas on Earth? User dnttellmymm Phosgene? I do n't know. Probably something I 've never heard of. Can that polonium stuff be a gas? User biochick ' 03 I meant the most toxic COMMON gas. It 's oxygen. We need it to Uve, but back in evolutionary history the first photosynthetic bacteria nearly poisoned the planet with it before everything else either adapted or went underground. User astroman-Fort. Worth So you 're saying oxygen 's a weapon? User biochick ' 03 Maybe. Or maybe I 'm wrong and we 're all dead. Any better ideas? User Garden Warrior Not from me. I found the gas mask and it seems to work. Or maybe it 's just going tiirough the motions. If there 's a way to check these things out, I do n't know it. User biochick ' 03 You also have to worry about dermal toxidty. Lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, gloves, etc. I ca n't promise they 'll work, but they ca n't hurt. User Garden Warrior Already doing it. So have you guys come up with a plan? User simpleguy38304 Yeah, swim, then run. User misteri 2 Why not just call the cops? User astroman-Fort. Worth I 've been trying to do just that, but ca n't get through. GW, 12 's right : it 's not your job to save the world. Or Iowa or however far this stuff might spread. User geolojest-bttl I 'm betting it 's going for the world. IJS whether it 's astroforming us or just trying to make a kudzu plantation, it 's going to need to change more than a corner of Iowa. User Garden Warrior When I was a kid, my dad used to take me camping. Before we 'd go home, he 'd insist on cleaning up all the trash, even U it was n't ours. " If we do n't, nobody else will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think anyone else is going to get to this in time. I just switched on CNN. Every third word is " terrorist. " Even if we could reach FEMA or Homeland Security, I doubt they 'd take us seriously. So, to do it ourselves, what do we need? User biochick ' 03 Oxygen, lots of it. Some way to break into the pipes. Then a way to blow the oxygen into them, preferably without dying first. Sure you do n't want to run? User Garden Warrior Nope. Let 's see what I can scrounge up. WeVe got a hospital, a high school that 's presumably got a chem lab, and a couple of hardware stores. I doubt any of that 's locked, but I 'll take a crowbar, just in case. Wish me luck. User biodiick ' 03 Good luck! Here 's my ceU phone number if you need it. <Link : Personal side-note> I should have thought of that before. User astroman-Fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to suggest a moratorium on chatter until GW gets back. Time 's going to be vital, so let 's not make folks wade through 101 useless posts. Only post if you Ve got something important to say. User dnttellmymm Sounds good to me. User simpleguy38304 Me too. But who died and made you king? User biocWck ' 03 Shhh. User Mister 12 One question. Why did GW get bypassed? Why did n't it gas him as it was tunneling by? User astroman-Fort. Worth Who knows? Maybe it figured it made more sense to start in the middle of town. If " figuring " plays any role in its behavior. Maybe it 's genetic. Or programmed. User simpleguy38304 The stuff 's continuing to spread. Ten miles now. He better get back soon. User biocWck ' 03 I just got a call from Wm! He sounds pretty stressed, even through the mask. It seems he 's just about the only living thing left in town. He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W a truck he borrowed when he found it blocking a street - though apparently " borrowing " meant pulling out the owner 's body. User dnttellmymm Did he know die guy? User biocWck ' 03 I do n't know, but it 's a pretty small town. AU he said was it looked like the guy had coughed up big chunks of Ws lungs. The rest of the town, he says, is just plain eerie. Dead animals everywhere, aU the leaves dead on the trees, but just waving in the breeze, not falling off like it 's autumn. There 's nothing green anywhere near the city center, but at least his gas mask worked. And he 's mad as hell. He too 's been thinking about the fact the pipes bypassed him, and figures it means they did n't take him seriously. He wants to make them pay for that, but is going to need help. User dnttellmymm That 's what we 're here for. User biocWck ' 03 I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to text without taking his gloves off. He says the gas is indeed coming out of storm sewers, though only a few of them, so there must be a system of valves down there to direct it. He tried blowing oxygen directly into a sewer grating, but it just blew back out. He compared it to trying to use one baUoon to blow up anodier. What should he do next? User astroman-Fort. Worth He needs to drill a hole in one of the upstream pipes and inject gas into it via an airtight fitting. That means getting back to his own yard, with... let 's see, in addition to a drill, some copper tubing, superglue, quick-setting caulk, duct tape, super-strong strapping tape, and maybe some caustic chemicals to soften up the pipe. What would they have in that high school lab? Sulfuric acid? Sodium hydroxide? Tell him to get some extra drill bits, because those chemicals may be as hard on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be careful to drip the chemicals on only one spot or he 'll make too big a hole when he breaks through, and have the storm-sewer problem all over again. User simpleguy38304 If he breaks through. User astroman-Fort. Worth Yeah, for all we know that stuffs immune to anything he can do. But as biocWck said, then we 're all dead, so we might as weU presume he 's got a chance. One other thing : he 's going to need water to rinse off the acid, so it does n't eat through his fitting. Anything else? User dnttellmymm An extra day to collect all this stuff? User astroman-Fort. Worth Good point. Tell him that if he ca n't find everything, use what he can find. User biocWck ' 03 He 's on the way home. Drilling commences in... five minutes? User misteri 2 I hope his protective equipment holds up. User biochick ' 03 Me too. He 's home, trying the drill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tries to push down on it and barely leaves a mark, even though he got a diamond-carbide bit from someone-or-other 's machine shop. User simpleguy38304 Damn. If this does n't work, do you think the feds will figure it out in time to do something useful? Nuke the place, in nothing else. Heck, they 'd never do that. Fallout in Iowa. Fat chance. They 'd let the aliens kill everyone first. User biochick ' 03 He 's trying the acid now. He says he can now scratch the pipe, but not by much. He rinsed it off and tried the base. Same result. It works... but only slightly. He wants to know what would happen if he tried to alternate them without rinsing. User astroman-Fort. Worth Lots of heat. Hmm, it might actually work. Who knows what that stuffs thermal properties are. TeU him to watch out ; the mix might spatter, and if he holes his gas mask... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear. It 's working! The pipe did n't soften - it cracked. He 's in. User biochick ' 03 Widening the hole now, just enough to fit the tubing. Washing off the acid. He says gas is blowing out, but not all that hard. Apparently the flow is steady but not high pressure. User biochick ' 03 Mounting the fitting... Good, superglue binds to the pipe... Caulk. Duct tape. He 's got it set so when one oxygen cylinder empties, he can take it out and put in another. User dnttellmymm Oh yeah! Is it working? User biochick ' 03 Too early to tell. He says that while he 's waiting, he might as well attack the other pipes. He also says he 's got an idea for another surprise for the allens- he seems to think they 're terraformers, not kudzu. Meanwhile, he wants to know how long it 'll take the oxygen to permeate the system. User astroman-Fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hours? Too many unknowns. How much has he got, anyway? User biochick ' 03 Enough that his back is going to hurt tomorrow from lugging it around, he says. There 's more where it came from. User biochick ' 03 OK, there were six pipes total, counting one that was n't technically in his yard. He 's into all of them, and on his second round of oxygen tanks for the first couple. He 's now drilling second holes into them, hoping to double the dose. User biochick ' 03 His grass is dying, but everything 's under control, he says. So he 's off for more oxygen... and his surprise. User dnttellmymm Man, I hope it 's a good surprise. My girlfriend thought she 'd surprise me for my birthday and got... never mind. Let 's just say that toni was part of it. Ha! Let 's give the aliens some tofu! User biochick ' 03 What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else in mind, but he wo n't say what. User misteri 2 Is n't oxygen enough? What are they saying on CNN? Is it having any effect? User astroman-Fort. Worth While he was working, the death zone was still expanding, but, let me check... yes, the rate of expansion has decreased. That does n't prove anything but it 's a good sign. User biochick ' 03 " Great " he says, though he adds it would be nice if the gas mask allowed him to drink some coffee. How long do we think he should keep this up? User astroman-Fort. Worth No idea. At least until the death zone quits expanding. User biochick ' 03 He 's off for a third truckload of oxygen. He says that 'll be the end of it. User astroman-Fort. Worth Damn I wish we could have gotten the feds to listen. They 'd have had a boatload of the stuff. Still, the death zone 's not expanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as far as the stuff planned to go. User biochick ' 03 OK, he 's back. Replacing empty oxygen tanks and starting to add his surprise to some of the taps. He stUl wo n't say what it is. " I love you guys, " is aU I can get out of him. It has something to do with the second holes he 's drilled in all the pipes. User biochick ' 03 Oh no! He 's finally told me. I ca n't stop him! User simpleguy38304 What the hell is it? User biochick ' 03 Propane! He 's been adding it now for an hour. He figures a big explosion might make a nice coup de grace. He 's going to kill himself! User misterl2 Holy cow! Did you see that? Fox News had it. User dnttellmymm So did CNN. Wha 'd he do? Toss in a match? User biochick ' 03 Pretty much. User astroman-Fort. Worth Well he sure did something. They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ User Farmer John X Hell, he probably did n't need the propane. That stuffs probably flammable enough on its own. Ever try lighting a cow fart? Kinda like that, I bet. User simpleguy 38304 You speaking from experience? User astroman-Fort. Worth Who knows, but he 's got a point. If we 're right that the aliens do n't like oxygen, odds are they live in a reducing atmosphere, which means any gas they do like is probably pretty explosive. User simpleguy38304 What about the impact site? User astroman-Fort. Worth From the aerials, it looks like he got that too. I 'd been worried because the oxygen probably was n't blowing upstream. But it looks like the fire took out everything. I bet it ruptured the pipes, then produced a big backdraft or something. User nojest-bill What about GW? He must have cooked himself. Will anyone ever know he saved the worid? User biochick ' 03 I do n't know about that, but he 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than missing eyebrows and stinky hair, he made it! He was out of contact because the blast knocked him silly, but he 's mostly with it, now. Unfortunately, his house is on fire, but there are also flames all the way back to the river, so he 's sure he got the source. If nothing else, when the flames subside, there will be all kinds of holes for air to get in and finish the job. Not that the feds will ever give him credit User dnttellmymm Or us. User biochick ' 03 True. But you know, I do n't think I care. What 's the cheapest way to get to Iowa, anyway? User simpleguy38304 Swim, then run? User lumpylawnnot Jnjowa Hey, I just found this forum, and I 've got moles. Really. Zigzagging all across my lawn. Does anyone here actually know what I can do about them?
