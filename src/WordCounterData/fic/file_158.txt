4024241 I went to find Hayden Carruth when I was living in Vermont in the mid-seventies and he was running his small farmstead, patching together a living with literary hackwork, haying, tractor repair, barn-building, and any other money-eking enterprise, on a hill outside Johnson about forty miles from me. When I phoned in advance, his was the quietest telephone voice I 'd ever heard ; each sentence seemed to fade toward silence as it closed. His best poems are like that, softspoken, plain, even when the emotional signature is hacked or burnt into hardwood, and they possess absolute candor about everything. He 's the least self-censoring person I know, his honesty embedded in Camus ' writings, which were foundational for him. So there we were one summer afternoon sitting on the small porch of the modest house he kept with his then-wife Rose Marie. He 's chewing on his pipe stem, looking off into the distance. He gazed - his conversation seemed aimed at some elsewhere. He lived so deeply inside himself that he makes the oily, **25;334;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. When I pulled out my cigarettes, he cadged one. // - A little whiskey would go well with this. // So there we were, smoking Luckies, sipping Jim Beam or some other corny liquor, when a typical country Vermont oil-burning junker too large to fit in most people 's living rooms rattles past. // - Glad I do n't have to earn money fixing those things anymore. // He was n't talking about a summer job. He 'd done everything except teach, which would come later. He called himself a hack because he 'd done, for money, just about every sort of writing and editing, working in the cowshed we could see from the porch. I asked about the stream that ran near his house. // - You 're a Vermonter, you should know it 's not a stream, it 's a brook. // - I 'm not a Vermonter. I 'm from South Philadelphia, you know that. We 'd call it a creek, a crik. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. // We talked for hours. He loved Dryden 's dramatic lyrics and put me on to the poetry of Paul Goodman, whom I knew from the frantic sixties only as a social critic. We smoked up a storm. Smoking has been one of his greatest pleasures. Back then he went through twenty pipes a day easy. In his autobiography, Reluctantly, he describes an uncle smoking : " He would talk and exhale smoke at the same time, so that the smoke came out every whichway, as if it were the ectoplasmic embodiment of his language. " PANIC // One pick-up job was his stint as editor of Poetry in 1950. He was proud he never kept a poet waiting more than five weeks for an answer. But he riled the board - he was trying to revamp and amp up things with more challenging poems and feistier prose - so within a year he was out. He loved Chicago for its jazz and blues and can still run down the sidemen on many sessions, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities. He did n't like having too many people around and suffered disabling panic attacks and other agonizing psychological ailments that afflicted him but lived in the shadow of the major one - suicidal depression. CALIFORNIA // Early nineties. He visits me in California. We drive over an old stage road to the ocean and along the way, while he blows cigarette smoke out through the window like a teenager, he asks the names of trees, grasses, flowers, stuff he 's never seen. He points to a shrub with smoky blue flowers. // - What 's that thing? // - Ceanothus. They call it California lilac. // - But it 's not lilac. Does n't look anything like lilac. // That night I cook minestrone and joke about how Italians cook vegetables to kingdom come. // - So did my grandmother. Cooked the hell out of ' em. I do the same. This is good. ITALIAN RESTAURANT // Mid-nineties and he 's back in California to read at Stanford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I find him at the bar of a trendy Italian restaurant in Palo Alto. He 's retired from Syracuse and lives in Munnsville, an upstate New York hamlet briefly famous for a fratricide documented in the movie My Brother 's Keeper. We have n't seen each other in a few years and make small talk until the bartender drifts over and asks our pleasure. // - Get Chianti( the only red Hayden seems to drink). // - I 'll have a Prosecco. // -( Bartender) Sorry, sir, we do n't have that. // - How can you call yourself an Italian restaurant and not serve Prosecco? // - Right! That 's telling him! You have to make yourself heard. Bring this man a glass of Chianti! // At dinner with his vivacious wife Joe-Anne, Hayden looking much older since his last visit, he 's telling a story and trying to set it in context. // - That was about six months after I killed myself, right, Joe-Anne? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his suicide attempts, the time he came closest, in 1988, when he took every pill in his possession - and there were many indeed to take. His first knowledge of the suicidal impulse, involving more smoke, is recorded in Reluctantly. As a twelve-year-old sitting on a riverbank with a flirty girl who challenges him to toss away the pack he 's smoking, he throws it into the river. The image of the pack falling and floating away lived powerfully in him ever after : " Why did n't I pitch myself after it and dash out my brains on the rocks below? " It would have been that easy, even then. ON A WALK // As part of his visit, Stanford has arranged a TV interview. The morning of the taping, he tells Joe-Anne he 's stepping out for a little air. The event coordinator arrives to pick him up but Hayden 's nowhere in sight. The coordinator waits, Joe-Anne waits, the studio waits. After an hour, everyone( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit tells him to do) is frantic. Should they put out a missing persons report? Will they need a helicopter? Will the TV affiliate hate Stanford? Fast-forward the crisis. A few hours later, Hayden re-appears at the Faculty Club where he 's been housed. The coordinator is a wreck ; Joe-Anne frets not at all. // - I just had a nice long walk. It 's quite beautiful here. What 's wrong? W.S. Di Piero // Because He Was Flesh // Frank MacShane, the biographer of Raymond Chandler, was the first one to introduce me to Edward Dahlberg. He gave me his book Because I Was Flesh and then, when I was finished, he gave me his address so I could write a fan letter. I had never done such a thing before. It was 1965. I was twenty-four. Dahlberg answered me immediately and for a couple of years I would receive letters from him that were both solicitous and patriarchal. In a certain sense these letters changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was said to be the originator of the proposition that one perception must immediately lead to the next - a proposition that drove American poetics from after ww11 on - was not a poet unless you call a highly-charged, iambic, metaphorical prose " poetry. " Some people call Moby-Dick a poem. I call Because I Was Flesh a poem as well as Dahlberg 's less known book, Bottom Dogs. Perhaps it is simply a term of respect for those who push language to its limit. // Dahlberg left a burn mark on whomever he met ; he branded his students and friends and then abandoned them as his mother had for a time abandoned him. He even broke off with the other priapic genius Charles Olson over the value of Moby-Dick. Dahlberg wrote that " Moby-Dick is gigantology, a tract about a gibbous whale and fifteen or more lawless seamen, who are alone, by choice, though they are together. " He was against Melville, who may have been too strong an influence. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady barber. And in order to get a flavor of the man one must read lines like these, describing the orphanage where he spent childhood time : They were a separate race of stunted children who were clad in famine. Swollen heads lay on top of ashy uniformed orphans. Some had oval or oblong skulls ; others gigantic watery occiputs that resembled the Cynocephali described by Hesiod and Pliny. The palsied and the lame were cured in the pool of Bethesda, but who had enough human spittle to heal the orphans ' sore eyes and granulated lids. // Dahlberg talked and wrote like this. Unlike Charles Olson, whom he 'd met at Harvard and whose work would always return to postwar Eurpoean philosophy and American politics, the autodidactic Dahlberg had identified with the proletarian underground since the twenties - and with ancient texts ; he went into seven years of withdrawal from writing to study these. His first book, Bottom Dogs, had an introduction by D.H. Lawrence. After his withdrawal, he renounced his former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all men who aspired to write, and his early works. // In a letter written to me in December, 1966, he wrote : Now, you ca n't admire Tolstoi along with Joyce, Jane Austen and Henry James. That 's the usual academic pother of the day. Should you have understood Tolstoi you wo n't be able to read the famous rubbish of James, Joyce and Austen. You must learn how to expurge what is foolish, bad garbage ; otherwise you 'll never find those values you long for and should possess. Now, I know it is well-nigh impossible to give people good advice, particularly when you 've got no doctrine or dogma to go along with it. But just take from an experienced worm of prose style that this kind of chaotic and amorphous thinking will be a fell obstacle to your own ripening. // We met in cafes in New York and once at Elaine 's where he was disgusted by what he saw. I was proud to be with him, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest, my desire to please him. He sent me a list of writers I was instructed to read by June, 1967. This is that list, verbatim : Osiris by Wallis BudgeEgypt by MasperoThe Book of Job by Morris JastrowThe Song of SongsThe Gentle CynicThe Voyage of the Beagle by DarwinL'Amour by StendhalPhysiology of Marriage by BalzacEnquiries into Plants by TheophrastesThe History of GreeceGreek Poets by John Addington SymondsLives of the Greek Philosophers by Diogenes LaertiusLast Essays by Eric GillProlegomena to the Study of Greek Religion by Jane HarrisonAmiel 's JournalThe Goncourt JournalsImaginary Conversations by Landor // And later he handed me a further list : Burton 's Anatomy of MelancholySir Thomas BrowneTwelve Caesars by SuetoniusAnimals and Birds by BuffonLes Characteres by LydellLove of the Nymphs by PorphyryGil Bias by Le Sage // Dahlberg had no interest in mystical thinking. Myth was good, but best was the point of view of the naturalist and the anthropologist. I read some of the above, but concealed from him my other reading( then mostly European fiction in translation - Montale, Camus, Duras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't handle. I was a sucker for bullies. I submitted, I even married them, but I did n't grovel or let it go on too long. // My friendship with Dahlberg ended bitterly. He chased me around his apartment on Rivington Street with his pants down, having locked the door from the inside, and I had to leap out a window to get away from him. My last letter from him was a racist diatribe against my marriage and the wasting of my " sweet, honeyed flesh. " // What I received from him, before this event, was invaluable : the sense of the writer 's life as a religious vocation. You had to protect yourself from Philistines, and read what he would call " ethical " writing. That is, writing that is so conscious of potential falsehoods, contradictions, and exaggerations in its grammar, it avoids becoming just one more symptom of the sick State. Dahlberg told me to take a vow of poverty if I was serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart, not the head, and he insisted on seeking a physicality in language that was palpable. This was his politics, he who had been a card-carrying Communist, and to this day I believe he was right. I was like one of his orphans, starved for truths that he gave me : Though all day long nothing was in the ailing minds of the orphan-asylum Ishmaels but the cry for food, what these mutes ask for was never given. O Pharisee, when will you learn that we never came to your table for the gudgeons and the barley loaves? Fanny Howe // // By W.S. Di Piero and Fanny Howe //
