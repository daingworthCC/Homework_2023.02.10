Neil 's voice is street, but his language is precise like an engineer 's. He 's very careful and very good.

He looks like a construction worker by day who by night hits L.A 's slams, jams and raves. He 's 29, from Austin, Texas. Chris is also a highline pro : a boxman who knows five ways to open any safe made. Right now he 's buying a hollow core drill.
