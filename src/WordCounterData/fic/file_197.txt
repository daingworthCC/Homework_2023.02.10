4120941 Berlin, Germany <p> March 21, 1938 <p> First day of spring, and pregnant with the same expectancy that <p> gripped Kurt Raeder at his unexpected summons from <p> Reishsfhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler. The Prussian sky was cold, ragged <p> sunlight dappling the German capital with that glitter atop iron that <p> promised an end to winter. So might Himmler be the pagan sun to <p> part the clouds of Raeder 's stalled career. So might Raeder win his <p> own expedition. <p> " We have read with interest your books on Tibet, " the summons <p> stated. With that simple missive the explorer had been yanked out of <p> the ennui of his university teaching and the gloom of his wife 's death, <p> the opportunity like the twin lightning bolts of the SS Rune. <p> As Raeder walked from the U-Bahn into the heart of Nazi power, <p> Berlin seemed to share his anticipation. The city was its habitual <p> gray, buds swollen but little green on the trees yet. The paving was <p> bright from a night 's rain, however, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the new steel tanks that had waited on the <p> border for the Anschluss with Austria just nine days before. Now the <p> two nations were united in a single German Reich, and once more <p> public apprehension about a Nazi gamble had turned to excitement <p> bright as the red swastika banners, vivid as a wound. All the world <p> was waiting to see what Germany would do next. All Germany was <p> waiting to see what Hitler would do next. His New Order was <p> improbably succeeding, and on Wilhelm-Strasse, marble blocks and <p> columns were stacked to the sky where the Fhrer 's imposing <p> Chancellery was rising. Speer had promised completion in less than a <p> year, and workers scrambled across the pile like frenzied ants. People <p> watched, with pride. <p> Raeder secretly liked the theatricality of his black SS uniform and <p> the medieval ritual of SS indoctrination. It meant brotherhood, the <p> satisfaction of being one of the chosen. Entry into the new German <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been a way <p> to establish Aryan ancestry and win a measure of grudging deference <p> in a university system glacial in its advancements. But while appointments <p> had come quicker with the exodus of the Jews, Raeder 's brief <p> fame had not solidified into promotion. <p> University intellectuals were snobbish toward the Nazis. At school, <p> Raeder had mostly avoided the costume, preferring to blend in with <p> high starched collar and restricting tie through years of brief celebrity, <p> dull instruction, and finally private tragedy. <p> But now the Reichsfhrer SS had somehow taken notice. Here <p> was the hinge of Raeder 's life. So the young professor had put on the <p> Schutzstaffel uniform with its runic insignia, both proud and <p> self conscious. When his faculty colleague Gosling spied him from a caf <p> and joked about it, the zoologist managed the good humor to shrug. <p> " Even scholars have to eat. " <p> Life, the Nazis preached, was struggle. <p> Raeder knew he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too dark <p> to be ideal, perhaps, but handsome and fit from his explorations : <p> erect, wiry, what a German youth might wish to be, the new man, <p> the Aryan prototype. Crack shot, alpinist, university scholar, hunter, <p> author, and scientist for the Third Reich. Lotte 's death had not been <p> publicized, out of deference to his achievements. His self-doubt he <p> kept to himself. <p> Almost unconsciously, Berliners swerved around his uniform on <p> the crowded Wilhelm-Strasse, a caution he accepted as normal. The <p> SS was not to be loved, Himmler had preached. But Untersturmfhrer <p> Kurt Raeder, adventurer! His resolute gaze had been in magazines. <p> Women swept by him and peeked. <p> Pedestrians thinned as he walked past the sterile, massive headquarters <p> of Gring 's new Air Ministry, the power of the Luftwaffe <p> implied by its modernist bulk. And then thinned still more as he turned <p> left onto Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse and arrived at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany. Here was the home of the Reich <p> Security Ministry, which included the SS and Gestapo. Next door <p> was Number 9, the Prinz-Albrecht-Palais Hotel, also subsumed by the <p> growing security bureaucracy. To Raeder 's eye the home of the police <p> was a more inviting structure than the plain severity of Gring 's <p> headquarters. With classical arched entry and Renaissance styling, the SS <p> buildings harkened back to the more refined nineteenth century. Only <p> the black-clad sentries who flanked the door hinted at its new purpose. <p> There were rumors of Gestapo cells in the basement. There were <p> always rumors, everywhere, of the very worst things. This was good, <p> Raeder believed. Menace promised security to those who followed the <p> rules. None could deny the Nazis had brought order out of chaos. <p> While the democracies were flailing, the totalitarian models -- <p> Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan -- were on the rise. <p> This building was the fist of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hush inside, like a church. A grand stairway with thick <p> balustrade, steps carpeted in red plush like a movie palace, led up a <p> flight to a vaulted entry hall. The only decorations were three <p> hanging swastika flags and busts of Hitler and Gring. Public depictions <p> of Himmler were rare ; his power was his air of mystery. Bare wooden <p> benches as uncomfortable as pews lined one side of the waiting area, <p> glacial light filtering in from arched, frosted windows. At the far end <p> three steps led to another entry( like an altar, Raeder thought, <p> continuing the church analogy) with black-clad guards presiding instead <p> of black-robed priests. Himmler had modeled his elite on the Jesuits, <p> and SS zeal on the discipline of the Inquisition. <p> Raeder 's credentials were checked and he was admitted to a more <p> private reception area, the offices beyond barricaded by a massive <p> counter of dark-stained oak, stout as a dam. Now a more thorough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the type the SS <p> put on its posters. The officer scrutinized his insignia skeptically. <p> " An Untersturmfhrer to see the Reichsfhrer? " <p> Raeder showed the letter that had summoned the SS lieutenant <p> from his residence in the respectable Wilmersdorf district, the apartment <p> haunted now since Lotte 's death. " The Reichsfhrer expects all <p> ranks to serve. " <p> The comment drew no reaction from a man with the expressiveness <p> of a robot. " Wait. " <p> The explorer stood stiffly as the orderly spoke into a telephone <p> and then returned it to its cradle. The guard did n't bother to look at <p> Raeder again. <p> Long minutes passed. Raeder could hear the faint clack of heels <p> on tile, the cricket-murmur of typewriter keys and code machines, the <p> rumble of wooden file drawers sliding out and slamming home. Each <p> muffled ring of distant phone was answered before it could jangle a <p> second time. All was whispered, as if the ministry building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the basement muted, too? <p> The colors were institutional green and cream, the lights a somber <p> yellow. <p> " This way, Professor Raeder. " <p> Another SS officer, a Sturmbanfhrer, thicker and pinker, briskly <p> led him into the maze of corridors beyond. They wound one way and <p> another, climbed a flight of stairs, and wound again. Raeder was <p>( perhaps deliberately) lost. The office doors they passed were shut, shapes <p> moving behind obscured glass. The few people in the hallways were <p> male, hurried, boots drumming, conversation a murmur. The walls <p> were blank. Floors gleamed. The calm efficiency, the monkish <p> concentration, the paper-and-glue smell of a library... it was admirable <p> and disquieting. <p> Then more SS guards as strapping as Vikings snapped to attention, <p> a double door swung open, and they came to a high-ceilinged <p> anteroom paneled in beech. Sentries checked Raeder for weapons <p> and scrutinized his identification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the minimum. It was a wordless play, the anteroom dim, <p> windowless. He was in the middle of a vast hive. <p> A knock on a side door, an answering buzz, and he was ushered <p> through. <p> Raeder expected another corridor, but instead found himself in <p> a modest painted office, with a lower ceiling than in the anteroom <p> outside. A single window looked out on a courtyard, the wall it faced <p> blank stone. No one from outside could look in. There was a large but <p> plain desk, left over from some Prussian ministry, and three leather <p> chairs in front of it. Behind sat the second most powerful man in <p> Germany. <p> Himmler looked up from a manila file and gave Raeder an owlish <p> blink. With round spectacles, receding chin, and narrow shoulders, <p> the Reichsfhrer SS was nothing like his praetorians outside. In fact, <p> he resembled a bank clerk or schoolmaster. He had a thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, womanly hands. His hair was shaved <p> close to the skull above his ears in the dull helmet shape of Prussian <p> fashion. <p> A much fiercer portrait of the Fhrer looked down on them with <p> burning zeal : that shock of black hair, that punctuating mustache. <p> The office was otherwise absent of decoration. There were no <p> personal pictures or mementos, just a wall of books, many of them <p> old, leather-bound, and cracked. Raeder could n't read the faded <p> titles. The Reichsfhrer 's desk was as neat as that of an accountant, <p> stacks of files with colored tabs precisely squared and ranked. Either <p> this was not Himmler 's regular office or the Reichsfhrer had no <p> need of the baronial opulence of a Hermann Gring. The abstention <p> was eerie. <p> Himmler closed the folder and turned it so Raeder could discern <p> his own name and picture. <p> " Sit. " <p> The zoologist did so, sinking into a chair. Its legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking up at Himmler. The Reichsfhrer <p> smiled thinly, as if to relax his guest, but the chilliness simply <p> reinforced the man 's power. There was something oddly vacant about <p> the personality he projected, as if Raeder were meeting with a facade. <p> Then Himmler abruptly leaned forward in a disconcertingly <p> intense way, with a predatory glare like an insect, eyes obscured behind <p> the reflection of the glasses, purpose ignited as if with a match. <p> " Untersturmfhrer, " the security minister began without preamble, <p> folding his hands on Raeder 's folder, " do you believe in the <p> importance of blood? " <p>( Continues...) <p>
