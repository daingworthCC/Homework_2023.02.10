1012241 Any resemblance between new frontiers and old may be more than coincidence-and perhaps a bit silly! <p> <p> It was a hell of a morning to be driving to the Moon. Wind howled and buffeted the car. Tree branches littered the streets and sheets of rain pelted my windshield like a shower head turned on full blast from six feet overhead. The predawn light provided barely enough visibility to dodge the occasional mad jogger and bicyclist. " This had better be important, Lester, " I murmured to myself while swerving to avoid the storm-amputated limb of an evergreen tree. " We work twelve hours a day, and then you wo n't even let me get four hours sleep without calling me back! This had better be important-or I 'll personally bury Pecos alive under a ton of regolith! " Sipping my mocha, I steered my battered Toyota into the business park and pulled up to the Pegasus Lunar Mining Corporation suite. I flung open the door-and was startled to see Wendell Huston, CEO and founder of Pegasus, sprawled over the receptionist 's desk. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head, and blinked. " Hello, Brian, " he said, and yawned. " Uh, hullo, Wendell, " I said. " Uh, what are you doing here, this time of morning? " " Morning? It 's morning? " Wendell checked the computer screen. " Man, I must have dozed off. I was reviewing the budget and-well, long story short, you and Lester had better find a strike quick, or we 're going to be hurting. " Through the office entrance 's glass door I could see a sticker in the corner of my windshield saying I needed an oil change six months ago. My two hundred thousand shares of Pegasus common stock would n't even buy me that. Wendell was n't telling me anything new. " Well, " I said, preparing to skip through a verbal minefield, " the latest drill samples look promising. " " That 's what Lester was- " " Brian! " Lester Kim hissed my name as only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so quietly neither of us had noticed. " It 's about time you showed up! " he bellowed. " I need you in Ops-right now! " Wendell straightened, the grogginess melted away. " You 've made a strike? " " Uh... no. " Lester shoved back his hair, badly in need of a trim, and studied the floor. " It 's more of an, uh, equipment problem. " " Oh. " The grogginess-and about ten more years-returned to Wendell 's face. " Well, good luck fixing it. Let me know how it goes. " " Brian. " Lester looked at me. " Please? " I drained my cup and tossed it in the trash. And okay, it was childish, but I stomped after Lester into the Operations Room. While I shed my threadbare overcoat and brushed off the raindrops, Lester shut the door and met my glare with his own. " I told you this was urgent, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also stopped for a " Help Wanted " sign in a drug store window. " I plopped in a chair and slumped. " God, Lester, when will this end? I 'm behind in my rent, they 're threatening to deactivate my cell phone, and that mocha blew my weekly breakfast budget. And you want me to spend my life here! Frankly, I 'd rather enjoy a real life on this world than some cowboy fantasy on another- " " Someone was snooping in camp last night. " I had n't enough sleep, and it was too early for a sledgehammer. " Huh? " " See for yourself. " Lester motioned toward VR Workstation 1. I sighed, and strapped into its sensory feedback devices : the seat that bucked and swiveled, the gloves that provided tactile stimuli, the VR helmet that immersed our audio-visual senses. Lester rolled over to Workstation 2, a motorized tilting platform adapted to his wheelchair. We slipped our helmets over our eyes. Desktop icons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloved hand and touched the square labeled Lunar Prospector 3.0. The VR gloves tweaked with a pulsed feedback, and the window interface opened. Wedged between the menu and task bars of a typical computer application was a scene of barren, cratered plains, beneath a black, star-powdered sky-with Earth glowing just above the horizon in the northeast. When I turned my head, the lunarscape turned with me. When I raised an arm, a mechanical claw rose into view. When I pressed a foot pedal, I felt the bumps and jolts of motion. All of this sensory experience is courtesy of Lunar Rover UN Registry WL65I-affectionately known as " Wiley. " Wiley is a robot the size of a toaster oven and lives on the Moon. He has wheels for locomotion, claws for grasping, and camera eyes for vision. Wiley 's telemetry signal travels over the Clavius Impact Basin regional cell phone network in the southwestern quadrant of the lunar near side, to an Earth-Moon radio communications system, to the terrestrial Internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a business park on Earth. Wiley does n't think ; I do that for him. Wiley inputs sensory data into my VR equipment, and I command him the same way. Wiley is pretty cool as alter egos go, and I like him. But unlike Lester, who is a VR fanatic, I can never forget I 'm in that business park. The Apollo astronauts gazed over the lunar horizon at Earth and experienced a cosmic paradigm shift. I see the same view through Wiley 's high-definition camera lenses and still worry about my rent. I was contemplating my lack of emotional immersion, when something entered Wiley 's field of vision. Another rover, a six-wheeled foot-and-a-halfer, trundled around a rock and approached. The rover was identical to Wiley, except the front registration label read PK23S-and the camera mounting wore a sombrero. It was Lester 's rover, " Pecos, " and it was a full-size sombrero. The camera pylon rose, and the sombrero rose as well. The sombrero turned as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registered Lester 's voice : " It 's in the lab. Come on. " Lester rotated a one-eighty and Pecos-the-Rover headed toward camp. Lester 's rover was n't faster than mine, but there 's a three-second signal delay while electromagnetic waves dash between Moon and Earth and back, so he got a considerable distance ahead and reached the nearest hill before I even started moving. I followed across the gray-green plains of craters and dust beneath a black sky. Entering our mining camp, we wended through the late lunar afternoon shadows cast by drills, carts, and our other prospecting gear which had been hauled up at enormous price from Earth( or manufactured on the Moon at **27;1613;TOOLONG price). Lester 's rover bee-lined toward a prism-shaped tent. I rolled in after. On the low table within lay row and column of slug-like lunar drilling samples. Neatly labeled and organized, they represented six months of searching for a palladium-rich fragment of the primordial asteroid that created the Clavius Impact Basin. " What 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place. " " Look harder. I 'll wait. " Lester 's rover picked up a cord and twirled a lasso. That 's difficult to do on the Moon in spite of the lower gravity, because of the signal delay. Lester practices all the time, and he 's good. Extending my claw, I yanked the cord away. " Do n't play games, Lester. Now, what makes you think a spy was here? " " Wheel prints. " I tilted my head down. Wiley did likewise, and I saw what Wiley saw : a crisscross of rover wheel prints imprinted on the moon dust. The vast majority of the prints were three inches wide, and had a v-mark in the center. They were our wheel prints. Then I noticed the new wheel prints. These were only an inch wide, and spaced four inches apart-a third of Wiley 's wheelbase. There was no v-mark. " Oh, " I said. " Did you check the security cam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed the prints? " " I figured we 'd do that together. Safety in numbers. " He exited the tent. I caught up, and we set off toward a nearby hill, following the wavering parallel lines of the intruder 's wheel prints in the steeply slanted sunlight of the final earthday of the two-week lunar daytime. We topped the hill, descended into a valley, and ascended another hill. A human being would barely notice the gentle lunar slopes, but our camera lenses were mere inches off the ground, and it was like riding through canyons. All the while, I felt watching eyes. " Do you see now, " Lester said, " why I wanted a gun? " " Whatever we 're following is n't much bigger than a pocket calculator, Lester. We do n't need a gun, we need a fly swatter. " The wheel prints abruptly ended, obliterated by larger prints-much larger prints. They were tractor tracks, not wheels, and as wide as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our human bodies as well as our minuscule rovers. An untutored investigator might look at the prints and conclude the big rover ran over the small one. We 'd seen this trick before, however. " Our spy hitched a ride, " Lester observed. " And you know there 's only one rover that big. " I bobbed Wiley 's camera mounting. " Bartholomew Palladium Consortium Excavator Number One. " Lester 's rover nodded back. " Yep. Big Bart himself. " My mind and my future were both cloudy. " We should tell Wendell. " " Wendell 's a great entrepreneur, Brian, but his talent is talking to potential investors and raising funds. His idea of action here will be to send a strongly worded e-mail to the UN bureaucracy. " Lester gets bombastic at times, but for once I could see his point. " So what do you suggest? " I asked. " We go into Clavius Gulch, " he replied, " and talk to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Station, and talk to the United Nations Lunar Policy Enforcement Representative. " " Sheesh, Brian! Everyone here calls it Clavius Gulch, and everyone calls him the sheriff. Why ca n't you deal with that? " I tapped one claw with the other. " One : I am never going to wear a cowboy hat on my rover. Two : I am never going to speak Old West Lingo. ' " I planted my claws against my sides. " We 're here to make money, not play games. " The sombrero swiveled back and forth. " Brian, you may not like the " lingo, " but here 's my assessment of the situation : Big Bart 's gang is claim-jumping. The sheriff needs to round up a posse and bring them to justice-or else, as you would put it, we wo n't " make money. " Now, aside from terminology, do you have any objection to what I 'm saying? " I thought about it, then sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robot 's got to do what a robot 's got to do. " " I swear, his rover gave me a wounded look. We left camp down a well-worn trail and traversed barren plains whose sterility would have intimidated any pioneer of yore. Of course, seeing Earth hanging in the sky( and " upside down, " no less) would n't have helped much in the sanity department, either. Eventually, a hand-made, hand-painted sign appeared : CLAVIUS GULCH POP. 102 Clavius Station is a few blocks of slapdash buildings built on rover-scale so that most are no bigger than a bedroom in an earthside home. Yet no matter how puny the warehouse, shop, or store, every third establishment has the word " Emporium " in its name. The unlighted streets, as dusty as anywhere else on the Moon, were thronged with microrovers like our own, nearly all of them wearing cowboy hats. At the patch of pavement loftily called a " spaceport, " a robotic lunar lander, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ module that had once transported humans to the Moon, was being offloaded by stevedore microbots. Other rovers, towing covered wagons, carried freight between spaceport and warehouses and the outlying mining camps that dot the Clavius Impact Basin. The center of town is dominated by a ten-meter tall spire, the space gun. We paused at the top of the hill to watch the load and launch operation. The spire tilted from near vertical to horizontal, pointing due northeast, down the length of Main Street. Bots stuffed refined palladium and a locator beacon into an artillery shell, then ramrodded the shell into the muzzle. The cylinder elevated again, until it targeted Earth. A robot at the space gun control panel pressed the firing button, which breaks the diaphragm between the pressurized gas tank and the discharge cylinder. The muzzle puffed vapor. The shell exited at lunar escape velocity-a mile and a half per second, too fast to see except on slow motion instant replay. Wiley 's interface software has that feature, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the space gun into the sky, coursing from Moon to Earth, a Jules-Verneian tale in reverse. The shell was bound for the shallow coral beds north of Australia, where a teleoperated minisub would retrieve the palladium payload four days later. From there the metal would find its way into a few of the quarter billion or so personal computer motherboards built annually on Earth. Palladium, precious as gold, was at the zenith of historical demand, rendering lunar mining a practical business proposition. " Someone 's making money, " I said, watching the gun lower again. " Or is " profit " too crass for your idealism? " Lester shook his rover 's head. " I only wish more of us were getting rich. But they need to clean up this town before that happens. " We rolled down the hill, past the graveyard of derelict rovers on Cemetery Hill, and drove among the collection of dilapidated structures that the locals called Clavius Gulch. Several robotic citizens tilted their hats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my rover. " Hello, Pecos, " they said to Lester 's. We knew them by their rover names too-Slim and Tiny and Big Red and Diamond Jim and Chester. The Moon 's " population " is so small that everyone knows everyone, almost. " The UN rep 's name is Laszlo, right? " I asked. " Yep, " Brian replied. " Sheriff Laszlo. " " Laszlo does n't sound like a Western-style nickname. " " Nope. I hear he 's a post-retirement civil servant, telecommuting from his personal computer somewhere in Southeastern Europe. The way his rover moves, he 's either drunk or connected by phone modem. " " You doubt he 'll help much. " " Yup. At least meeting him face to face will get more action than e-mail. " I steered toward the earthsky-blue globe of the UN office, but Lester deflected us toward a nearer, larger structure-with a giant neon-colored sign blazing in Mesquite font : MARLENA 'S PLACE LUBRICANTS OF ALL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lester said. " Of course, " I replied. " The wellspring of lunar lunacy. " " Brian, when are you going to get in the spirit? " " When it pays my rent, Lester. " We rode up the ramp in front of Marlena 's Place. Lester raised his claws and pushed open the swinging doors, and we entered the " barroom ". What we heard when we passed through the doors was the jangle of player piano music and a half dozen conversations roaring at once from the tables, where prospecting rovers sporting cowboy hats, bandannas, and firearms sucked on lubrication canisters doled out by tiny spider bots. All of the nonsquelching voices and sound effects in hard lunar vacuum were courtesy of radio transmitters placed about the room and the Sonic Simulation Channel signal-integration subroutines of our Lunar Prospector 3.0 software-which also registered a crash when a lubricant cylinder fell off a waiter 's tray behind us( do n't ask me how LP 3.0 does that ; I think it has something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @). Forced by company rules to continuously monitor vehicles whose construction and transport to the lunar surface cost millions of dollars, the human rover operators found diversions while their rovers were being serviced : an argumentative poker game in the corner, a European-style cabaret playing on a wall screen that to a microrover seemed as big as a theater stage. All in all, Marlena 's is a pretty elaborate set-up for what is essentially the lunar equivalent of an automobile lube shop. " Hello, boys, can I help you? " The sultry voice came from behind. We turned and Lester tilted his sombrero to a rover with a sleek, silver chassis adorned with jewels and pearl beads, and crowned by a towering lace headdress. " Howdy, Miss Marlena, " Lester said. " You 're looking lovely today, as always! " " Pecos, it 's always good to see you! " gushed the proprietress of the lubrication bar as her claw patted the side of Lester 's robot. The deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought Mr. Wiley T. Wet-Blanket with you. " " Brian will behave today. " " If he does, I 'll give him a custom hat for free. " Her camera mounting nodded toward nearby shelves, where several cowboy hats rested, everything from sombreros to Texan ten-gallons. Marlena makes the headgear herself : metal frames covered with fabrics grown in a hydroponics garden. Legend has it, in the early days of the Palladium Rush, she handed out hats to everyone who walked in her doors, which is how the whole lunar-cowboy fed got started. By the time I came along, though, she was charging a pretty price, and although I could understand that the cost was justified because it was timeconsuming to handcraft a hat using robot manipulators( with that aggravating time lag no less!), I saw no reason to waste money on something that is basically useless. Constantly being ribbed as " The Man With No Hat " made me all the more determined to remain hatless. " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is he here? " Marlena sighed and shrugged her manipulators, and pointed a silver claw toward the end of the bar. Mesmerized by the floorshow, nursing a mini-can of lubricant, was a dirty, banged-up rover. A UN badge dangled loosely on the foreplate. " Been there for hours, " Marlena said. " All he does is mope about how he ca n't do anything, he does n't have the authority. The so-called law in these parts! " Laszlo was oblivious to our approach. I saw his laser on the floor, fallen from its holster. Lester touched the sheriff 's chassis. Dusty lenses surveyed us like we were a pair of rattlesnakes. " Pecos, Wiley, " a quavering voice said. " What do you want? " " Someone broke into our camp, Sheriff, " Lester said. " They went into our lab and looked at our drilling samples. We think they plan to jump our claim. " Laszlo 's claw trembled as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rumor had it that rover and operator alike were heavy partakers of their respective lubricants. A lot of folks thought Laszlo was a do-nothing placeholder in a figurehead job. Maybe he 'd heard, and it was getting to him. " Any idea who it was? " Laszlo asked. " A microrover in Big Bart 's gang, " I replied. " Big-Bart! " His radio-transmitted voice bellowed across the room. Conversations fell silent and every pair of eyes( and the single belonging to One-Eyed Jack) turned on us. A small blurry shape darted to the entrance. It slipped through the gap beneath the doors before I could turn, but Laszlo had zoomed in. " Oh God, " he said. " That 's one of his boys. We 've got to get out of here- " Laszlo hobbled from the bar, dragging the tubing and canister with him. Lester latched onto the badge. " Sheriff, " Lester said, " do n't tell me you 're going to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world government! " " Sorry-wrong world! " He batted Lester away and retreated. Lester snapped a grip on the sheriff 's camera mounting and brought his lenses and the sheriff 's within inches. " Listen, we have property rights under UN edict, and you have to enforce them. What do you think we pay UN licensing fees for? " " So the UN will leave you alone, " Laszlo replied. " What, you want the UN to police the Moon? It can barely police Earth! " Lester 's arms flailed up and down like that old robot on Lost in Space. " You 've got to do something! " " I am! I 'm getting out of here before Big Bart comes-and I 'd advise you to do the same! " Too late. We all saw the lube cans jiggling from the floor vibration. Everyone turned toward the entrance. The doors flew wide and darkness blotted the sunlight, blocking the doors open. It was so huge, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracks instead of wheels, and spikes bristling atop slabs of armor plating. Its jet-black finish gleamed beneath the chandelier. Bulging compound lenses swept the barroom. The eyes trained on the three puny rovers in the back, and glowed red. The massive excavator machine barely cleared the ceiling of Marlena 's barroom-the biggest room in Clavius Gulch-as it plowed aside tables and chairs and rolled toward us. In truth it may have been only the size of a subcompact automobile, but to our beady little robot eyes, it bulked like a main-battie tank. The intervening prospectors scooped up lube cans and poker chips, and vamoosed. Laszlo shrank into the corner, trembling. Lester and I stood frozen. The wall of black armor stopped, and grapefruit-sized eyes glared from a height our fully extended manipulators could not reach. " WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU SAYING ABOUT ME? " The grill beneath the eyes flickered with the words, which boomed with a gravely deep, electronically distorted rumble. I had never seen Big Bart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw the claws, and dully realized that they were big enough to snap poor little Wiley in two. " Now, uh-Bart, Big Bart, " Laszlo injected, " the boys here were only saying that someone broke into their camp, and- " " AND THEY THINK I DID IT? " Banks of blood-red running lights flickered across his plates, stroking faster and faster. If it was done for intimidation, it worked. Okay, so none of us were actually in that room, and it was n't like Bart could send an electrical shock down our comm links and zap us. But if he smashed our uninsured rovers, Pegasus Lunar Mining Corp. would be out of business. Plus, Big Bart looks like he comes from the same planet as the alien that pops out of the guy 's stomach and eats everyone but Sigourney Weaver. Experiencing that through a high-def VR interface is more than enough to have the hackles on your backside do stretching exercises. " Now, now, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice sounded like he needed to take his own advice. " I-I did n't say you did anything. And they did n't say you did anything- " " No! " Lester shouted. " As a matter of fact, we do say! " The little prospector rover 's cameras tilted as far back as they could go, meeting the giant excavator 's gaze. " You sent a microrover to spy on us! " Lester said. " It left wheel prints all over our camp. " Pecos lowered its lenses toward Big Bart 's side compartment door. " I bet you 're carrying the microrover right now! " Big Bart stared at Lester. The room was silent, but for a chorus of static-the electromagnetic whine of a dozen rover motors racing for the door. Big Bart chuckled. Then his bulging right arm swung back, a batter tensed for the swing. " Lester! " I shouted. The whip-fast claw smashed into Pecos. The little rover flew over the bar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Shards of glass stabbed the lubrication canisters on the shelves, squirting black rain over the furniture, floor, and us. The chandelier, struck by stray debris, swung like a pendulum, rocking our shadows. Laszlo finally broke from paralysis. He fumbled over his holster, saw the gun on the floor, and grabbed it. Big Bart intently watched-like he was curious to see whether the sheriff had the guts. To my surprise, Laszlo did. The sheriff repeat-fired, batteries tumbling out of their chambers. A blinding flash hit Bart 's left eye, another the right. The last of the single-shot battery cartridges hit the floor and electrical discharges stopped pzzzting, but Laszlo spasmodically kept yanking the trigger. Visors had slipped over Big Bart 's eyes the instant Laszlo started shooting. Bart snatched Laszlo 's gun and the immense claws crumpled it like a tube of toothpaste. Then he pressed in, looming over the sheriff. A graceful, delicate silver appendage chopped in between. " What the hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small chassis, such a big transmitter! I almost tore off the earphones. Even Big Bart flinched-a little. " No more fighting! " Marlena glared at Big Bart. " The Shopowner 's Association will hear of this! If you do n't want to personally haul all your parts and supplies from Earth, I suggest you leave now! " Big Bart 's battle-eyes scanned her without expression. He still had a claw raised, and Marlena lay within its swing. They stood rock still, gazes locked. Bart 's claw lowered. The big rover backed off, turned, and lumbered through the lubricant-slicked room and among the broken furniture and out the doorway, prying a door off its hinges while squeezing through. " And this damage is going on your tab! " Marlena barked after him. I rushed to the bar and looked over. Pecos lay upside down. All his indicator lights were dark. " Lester, " I said. " Are you all right? " No reply. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helmet. His motion-feedback platform was skewed seventy degrees. Lester was sprawled on the floor of the Ops Room, his wheelchair overturned. Before the morning ended, we told Wendell. He was understandably upset, but did n't chide. Summoning us to the conference room, he put the company lawyer on the speakerphone. The conversation did n't go as envisioned. " I do n't understand, " Wendell said. " How did they get to be the injured party? " " I 'm not saying they are the injured party, " the lawyer replied. " But it is quite possible that Bartholomew Palladium Consortium will see it that way. " " Their guy hit me! " Lester blared. " There were witnesses! " " You mean, their robot struck your robot with an appendage. They could claim it was merely an electronic malfunction. " " Ca n't they be held legally responsible for damages caused by malfunctions? " Lester demanded. " What 's tangible here, " the lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is that you made certain remarks that defame the corporate character of BPC. You publicly accused them of criminality without evidence to substantiate. " " They left wheel prints all over our camp, " I said. " Easily fabricated. And my guess is they will claim that. " Lester opened his mouth, but Wendell waved him down. " So what is our legal game plan? " Wendell asked the speaker box. " Wait and hope they do n't file a defamation of character suit. If they do, we settle out of court. " " But we 're in the right! " Lester cried. " Lester! " Wendell paused. " Pegasus ca n't afford a protracted legal battle. " " Bartholomew can, " added the lawyer. " They have more attorneys than Pegasus has employees. They even have a Congressional lobbyist. Face it, we 're outgunned. " Lester slammed the tabletop. " This is n't right! This is n't fair! " " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suggest, " said the lawyer, " I 'm willing to listen. " Outside the window it was still raining, a miserable drizzle that might last days, weeks, eons. Wendell thanked our attorney and said good-bye. Then his eyes gave us their full attention. " Lester, the man 's doing the best he can. " " Where 's the justice, Wendell? " " Justice is an intriguing concept-but what 's it have to do with the law? " When Lester said nothing, Wendell continued : " Everyone knows the legal system is a crapshoot these days. People can bankrupt you with a lawsuit over slipping on the sidewalk outside your office. Megacorporations can rob you blind and toss you in jail for complaining about them. You have to know when to play and when to fold. This is folding time. " Lester brushed back his hair. " Is this how we serve the shareholders, by giving up? " From his pocket, Wendell produced his key chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the center. The little ball spun in the fluorescent light and twinkled rainbow sparkles like miniature stars. The curvature of the glass magnified the speck within, which glinted with hues of blue and green of an ocean that never was. " You know what this is, " Wendell said. " Your " Moon rock, " " Lester replied. " Yes, I must have shown it a thousand times in a thousand investment presentations during our start-up capitalization phase. " A trace of a smile passed over Wendell 's lips. " I bought it when I was still in grad school, not much older than you two. The first private-enterprise lunar probe had returned from the Moon with a kilo of lunar dust. Back then, we did n't have the space gun, and lunar samples came back via expendable rocket, and the rockets and their fuel had to come from Earth-all very, very expensive. So at the time, this speck was so rare it cost me half a semester 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I saw the destiny of the human race in space colonization, in spreading life to other worlds. To me, this dust particle was a seed, and it represented our first steps toward a glorious future. " First we 'd send mining robots. The profits would go to build more economical rockets, to carry bigger mining robots. Eventually, the rockets would be big enough to send human space pioneers. Then, the dream could begin. " " We 've all seen your charts and trend lines, " Lester said. " My point is, " Wendell said tersely, " Bartholomew Consortium is trampling my dream. The consortium exists for one purpose only-to keep the global palladium market from being flooded by cheap lunar palladium. Well, they tried fair competition with us entrepreneurial lunar mining companies, and they did n't succeed. They tried buyouts-and for every company they bought, two more sprang up, so that did n't succeed. They went to the government and tried to regulate us out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did n't succeed. They 've dumped palladium and driven the market price below sustainable levels, but we 're still in business, barely, and so they 're still not successful. So now they 're going broke themselves, and they 're desperate. " They 'll do anything to shut down the Moon. They do n't care if it means the end of the Space Age and the last, best hope of mankind to get off this planet. I ca n't fathom their materialism and greed, but there it is. " So I 'm no apologist for Bartholomew, Lester. I just want you to trust that I 'm doing all that can be done to preserve a dream that is sacred to both of us. " I squirmed in my chair. Wendell, fortyish, flabby, and balding, still had the power to convey his vision of teleoperated robots leading to real human space colonization-and to make space colonization seem the most important achievement the human race would ever accomplish. He had charmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me out of a career in corporate finance to come drive a toy robot around an airless desert. At that moment, caught between Wendell the Evangelist and Lester the Zealot, part of me wanted to walk out the door and never come back-before their insanity infected my heart and soul again. I did n't need to worry about humanity 's fate just then. I needed to worry about the fate of my phone bill. Lester looked at Wendell for a long time. Then he shook his head. " I 'm not sure I can trust you on that, Wendell. " Wrong thing to say, I thought, watching Wendell suppress a frown. " All right then, " Wendell said, slapping the table a little too hard. " But I 'm in charge and we 'll do it my way. Get your robot repaired-and you will steer clear of BPC from now on. In particular, stay away from that excavator unit of theirs. All right? " After a skimpy lunch, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, still parked in the saloon. The lubricant had been mopped up and the furniture moved back in place. A metal plate barricaded the street entrance. The barroom was deserted. " Marlena? " I called. " Inhere! " The Sonic Simulation Channel made it sound like her voice was coming from the doorway at the end of the bar. I rolled into a back room. Pecos, still inert, was righted on a bench, his slightly rumpled sombrero fastened in place. His left side was marred by a dent and scrapes. His access panel was open, and a rover wearing a black bowler hat was poking around my partner 's innards. Marlena hovered nearby, and nodded to me. She gestured to the rover with the bowler. " You know Doc. " I scanned Lester 's rover. " How is he, Doc? " " Seen better, " Doc replied. He reached into his little black bag, extracted a soldering iron, and probed the hole in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's got an alignment problem in his number three wheel axis, and to fix that I 'll need him on the rack at my place. " I shook Wiley 's head. " We ca n't afford major repairs. We 'll just have to live with it. " Doc withdrew the iron tip. " Maybe, before we go any further, we should discuss the small matter of payment for this call- " Before I could speak, Marlena intervened : " I 'll cover it. Just get this rover out of here, Doc. Dead patrons are bad for business. " Doc went back to work, with two spectators now. Finally, my conscience won over my annoyance, and I said, " Thanks, Marlena. I appreciate this, and I know Lester does especially. " " " Especially, " " she said. " You said that because he 's in a wheelchair. " My unseen face reddened. " Yeah. " " Well, I suppose we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Moon instead of dealing with real people on Earth. " " I 'm incredibly ugly, " I joked( I hope). " That 's my limitation. What 's yours? " " I 'm four foot one. " It took me a moment to realize she did n't mean her rover 's dimensions. " Not that it 's really a handicap like what Lester has, " she continued. " I can walk just fine. My car is modified so I can drive it. I never feel cramped in an airline seat. " I smiled, and wished she could see it. " But, " she continued, her mechanical arms hinting at a shrug, " it 's hard to be taken seriously when you 're standing in a nineteen inch hole. " For a brief moment, 1 thought I understood her at last. But when I thought further about it, she still did n't make sense.... " So now that you 're taken seriously, " I said, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat? " She laughed. " Brian, sometimes having fun is the most serious thing you can do. " " There, " Doc said. " That should do it. " He nudged in a circuit card, and Pecos 's indicator lights blinked on. " Hey! " Lester 's voice exclaimed. The response was immediate ; he 'd been sitting at his workstation, attempting to reestablish a comm link from his end. " I 'm back! " " I saw how hard you hit that mirror, and you 're very lucky, " Doc replied, snapping his bag shut. " If you ca n't afford my repair bills, I 'd advise you not to get into any more fights. " He tipped his hat to Marlena and bade us good day, and she let him out through the back door. Then it was just die three of us. " Lester, what were you thinking? " I demanded. " Well, I did n't think he 'd attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have torn the sheriff apart, too, if Marlena had n't stepped in. " " I doubt I stopped him for long, " Marlena said. " Characters like Big Bart do n't sit well with backing down from confrontations. " " So what can we do? " I asked. " The law wo n't help. " " Earth law, you mean, " Marlena said. " We have to make our own law here. " " Yeah, " said Lester. " Get a posse, and round up Big Bart and lois whole gang! " He 's become a parrot, I thought. " Get a posse, awk, awk, get a posse? " " A posse is n't enough, " Marlena replied. " UN jurisdiction courts would probably refuse to hear the case-or they 'd let Bartholomew loose on a technicality. " Her lenses zoomed on infinity. " What we need here is a revolution. " Napoleon Complex, I reflexively thought. " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do we declare independence from Earth when we 're still physically living there? " " I 'm not saying we declare independence. I 'm saying we set up a vigilante committee to mete out frontier justice. " I scratched the top of Wiley 's casing. " Vigilante, frontier justice... why do n't I feel comfortable with those terms? " " Because, " Marlena said, " you associate them with ignorant, dangerous rednecks. But those are precisely the kind of people that vigilante committees were formed to protect the public from. In the Old West, when a town government got too corrupt and ineffectual, the people would hold a meeting and elect new law enforcement officials. Well, we need to do the same. If we conduct this right, it 'll be Jeffersonian democracy in action. " She sounded like a history buff. Maybe Napoleon would have met his match in Marlena. I know I was beginning to feel overwhelmed. " Jeffersonian democracy, " I said. " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas Jefferson think of teleoperated robots on the Moon? " " He 'd know, " Marlena calmly replied, " that you ca n't adjudicate bar brawls from a courtroom a quarter million miles away. " I 'm certainly no history buff, and for all I knew, she was spinning this politicalscience discourse from thin air. And maybe she could get the rest of the town to buy into her brand of frontier justice, just like she had them going along with the silly hats and the hokey slang. But as for me, I had a flash of practical insight that cut through the philosophical crud : like everything else that had happened today, this conversation was n't paying the rent. " We 're in enough trouble without getting crucified as rebels, " I said. To Lester, I added : " Come on, " pardner, " I " reckon " it 's about time we " mosey " on back to camp. " Marlena made a noise that sounded like a growl. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to stop and wait outside the saloon. It was the top of the hour, and the space gun, in horizontal configuration, fired a test shell down the length of Main Street at the Calibration Target Monolith on the edge of town. Despite the wait, neither of us said anything. When the all-clear bell sounded, traffic resumed, and we steered up Cemetery Hill Drive with the Sun in our eyes. Pecos, limping from the warp in his wheel axis, kept pace as we passed the city limits and rejoined the camp trail. " You think she 's wrong, " Lester said. " About the revolution thing. " " Let 's put this in perspective, " I said. " We 're robots the size of poodles. That 's on the Moon. On Earth, it 's worse. We 're entry-level employees in a faltering startup venture. We 're not in a position to start a revolution. The way it looks to me, Marlena 's solution to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century. So instead of the Wild West in 1876, it 's now the American Revolution in 1776. Hang around long enough, and she 'll have us quoting Shakespeare and wearing codpieces. But all her fantasies have done is get your rover busted up. " He did n't speak for the rest of the trip. Maybe, for that brief spell, I was getting through. Then we reached the last hill. And saw fresh wheel prints. Big prints. " He 's been here, " Lester croaked. Spinning dust, he charged up the hill. I followed as fast as I could. At the top, we skidded to a halt and beheld the camp. Or what remained of it. Lester broke the silence : " No! No! No! " We raced down. A hurricane had descended upon the Moon : tents flattened, tanks punctured, the analyzer smashed, the drill rig missing, pipes bent, solar panels cracked. And everywhere those hideous huge prints-of tractor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No! " Pecos pounded the ground, gouging new craters. " We 're out of business, " I mumbled. Not next month, not next week. Pegasus Lunar Mining was for all practical intents and purposes out of business as of that very moment. Our working assets were destroyed and we had no insurance to cover the damage. Who needs insurance on the Moon? No floods, no fires, no storms, a major moonquake is a minor earthquake-and significant meteor impacts happen once a millennium. Vandalism and theft? The Moon has only ladies and gentlemen... right? Pecos scanned the dust for solar ionization build-up, which detects how recently regolith has been exposed to sunlight. " These wheel prints are fresh. If we go right now, we might be able to catch them. " Instead of immediately following the prints, however, Lester grabbed a shovel, rolled over to an outcropping of rocks, and started digging. " What are you doing? " I asked. " Getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. He dropped the shovel and reached into the hole, withdrawing a metal pipe with a bulge at one end-and a trigger in the middle. " What is that? " I asked. " Guess. " " Lester! " " Brian, it 's my own property. I bought it from the blacksmith, with what I made helping at the spaceport after hours. So it 's mine and I 'm going to use it. " Company management surely would n't appreciate Lester moonlighting( or would you call it earthlighting?) at the spaceport with its rover, but before I could lecture, Pecos bolted off, hot on the trail. " You 're acting crazy! " " Tell me what we 've got to lose! " I chased over hills, valleys, and plains of chalky lunar dust. Big Bart 's prints wound back into Clavius Gulch. Lester barreled down Cemetery Hill Drive onto Main Street, waving his weapon above his sombrero, and the rovers scattered. He stopped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simulation Channel dead quiet. The late afternoon Sun cast steep, black shadows. I half expected a tumbleweed to roll by. " Bart! " Lester shouted over the SSC. " Come out here, Bart! " He launched into a string of profanities, using every entry in the modern database. We might have been the only rovers in town for all the reaction. Lester exhausted his vocabulary and breathed hard. I thought he was done. Then, he bellowed throatity : " Big Bart-you low-down, good-for-nothing cowardly jackass! You 're nothing but a snake. You hear me, Big Bart? You hear me? Nothing but a filthy, yellow-bellied, stinking snake! " I wondered what Lester was doing-until I realized that Big Bart, like me, did n't wear a cowboy hat. Lester was assuming that the robot 's teleoperator found " Old West lingo " as grating as I did. Lester continued : " And you know what else, Big Bart? You 're worse than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Light beams flashed, from the intersection two blocks ahead. A hulking black crab on tank tracks trundled onto Main and confronted us, headlamps blazing and claws snapping. It stampeded toward Lester. Feeling my courage melt, I retreated to an alley. Lester remained dead center in the street. " Yeeeee-baaaw! " he yelled. He aimed his gun and pulled the trigger. The pipe tip puffed-and a spark flew off Big Bart 's hide. The crab kept charging. Lester fired again, and again. Bart closed within fifty feet, thirty, twenty. He abruptly stopped. He remained still, while sparks glanced off his armor and Lester ran out of bullets. Centered above Big Bart 's eyes, a circular door opened in the Neanderthal forehead. A barrel ten times the caliber in Lester 's claw emerged. It tilted down to point straight at Lester 's rover. It spat flame. Pecos exploded. Rover fragments and sombrero shreds rained upon the street. Before Big Bart turned, I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Earth, Wendell invited Lester and me into the conference room once more. Pegasus Lunar Mining 's chief executive officer listened quietly as Lester and I described the events since our last meeting. He did n't frown or shout, he did n't run about. He doodled circles on his scratch pad and asked questions in monotone. After our answers, he 'd nod, the only indication he was listening. Lester concluded our tale, and Wendell doodled in silence, the circles in tighter coils. It was rush hour, and traffic noises rumbled through the windows. A car belonging to someone in the neighboring insurance office splashed through puddles in the parking lot, the sound of someone with a real job going home to a real life. I felt a chill around my ankles from a draft, and wondered why the thermostat was turned so low. Then Wendell dropped the bomb and everything heated up. " I 'm sorry, Lester, " Wendell said. " We 'll have to let you go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not his fault our camp was destroyed! " " Lester twice provoked BPC, " Wendell said. " And the second time was in direct disobedience to my instructions. Regardless of whose fault it is, we 've lost millions of dollars in irreplaceable assets from the incidents. I can not go back to investors and ask for more funding without them asking if this is going to happen again. They 'll want disciplinary action. " He slashed an X through the circles, his only show of emotion. He raised blank eyes to Lester and said, " Lester, clean out your desk. I want you out of here today. You 'll receive two weeks " severance, of course. " I almost laughed. Did you have to quit to get paid around here? Lester 's face, though, quenched any humor. He backed away from the table, turned, and rolled out the door without a word. I followed him to the office spaces, reduced since the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already at his desk, yanking out the drawers and stuffing his personal items into a cardboard box. There was surprisingly little, for someone who almost lived at work. " You... want to go somewhere... and talk? " " Let me think this through on my own, first. " " Will you be all right? " " No. " " Let 's talk later, okay? " He never returned my gaze. He put on his jacket and gloves, and rolled toward the door with the box in his lap. Outside, he erected his umbrella. I watched him roll down the ramp, elevate into his van, and drive off without signaling to merge onto the busy arterial. I stood at the receptionist 's desk and felt my stomach churning. Lester had been fired for insubordination. If I kept my nose clean, I might last a month more until the company acknowledged financial reality and closed doors, and as a parting gift I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at another lunar mining company. Only, Big Bart was making sure there were n't any more jobs or companies like that. What did we have to lose? After dinner, I tried calling Lester. He did n't answer. I wandered in the local library and the shopping mall, and then I drove by the office. It was funny : after so many months of wishing for free time, that evening I felt like there was nowhere else I wanted to go. The lights were out and the door was locked, but I had a key( Wendell often referred to me as " The Responsible One "). I sat in my cubicle chair and swiveled around, looking at the space posters on the walls and thinking about how all these landscapes photographed by robot eyes might never be seen by human ones. It was as if we said, Space is too tough for us, and we surrendered exploration of the universe to the robots. Now it was as if we were deciding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though in this case, we humans had brought the menacing monster along with us from Earth-where we ourselves had constructed it. The fault lies not in the stars... indeed, our flaws as a species could well keep us from the stars. Out of habit, I clicked on my desk computer. I checked my e-mail. It turned out I had one message. A few minutes later, Wiley the prospector returned to Clavius Gulch and headed straight to Marlena 's. A new sign on the door read : BARROOM CLOSED FOR TOWN MEETING. A security camera visually frisked me and a rabbit hole in the metal plate opened long enough for Wiley to pass through. Marlena had e-mailed others, too. The barroom burgeoned with rovers, some sporting new foil insulation and others, like Wiley and the deceased Pecos, dented and dusty with experience. Sheriff Laszlo was n't apparent, and neither was Big Bart, Inc. I had arrived just in time, or maybe she was waiting for me. As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marlena ascended to the stage and peered over the hats and lenses. SSC chatter died. " All right, " she said. " You know why we 're here. The UN claims legal jurisdiction over the Moon, but is n't protecting citizens " interests. If we want justice, we have to get it ourselves. We 're going to establish a citizen 's tribunal. And, as our first order of business, we 'll bring Big Bart before it for all his crimes against us and our rights. " The crowd betrayed no emotion. I wondered why they were there. Me, I was curious to see how Marlena intended to pull this off. " As I mentioned in my e-mail, " she continued, " Pecos and Wiley here- " she waved a claw at me " -had their camp trespassed and destroyed by Big Bart 's gang. " She paused. " Pecos also was destroyed. " There was shifting in the crowd, and some murmurs. " We all know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palladium Consortium. A lot of you are afraid to tangle with BPC, which sometimes seems as powerful as any earthside government. So you 're lying low, hoping to survive by not being noticed. But if we let them get away with destroying one of us, they 'll eventually destroy all of us. Their business model is n't based on marketing warfare, it 's based on total warfare-and it 's not based on cutthroat capitalism, it 's based on cutthroat criminalism. So like Benjamin Franklin said, we either hang together-or hang separately. " After a sustained silence, someone raised a claw. " What do you propose? " " Elect a new sheriff, deputize a posse, arrest Big Bart, " Marlena said. " We 'll bring him back here and give him a fair trial by a jury of his peers-that 'll be us. It 'll be just like a court trial on Earth-except with common sense. " Another claw went up. " What about Laszlo? " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why should he stop us? " The crowd got restless, swaying like waves in a choppy sea. From somewhere in the middle someone yelled : " Forget this trial stuff! String him up! " Several voices yelled that-but then a huge blue claw, twice as big as a regular rover 's, shot up from the corner. Into the center rolled Iron Babe, the second biggest rover on the Moon. " I 'm no match for Big Bart, " he said. " I do n't think all of us put together are. So how do we overpower him? " " I 've got that covered, " Marlena replied. " But I 'd like to keep it a surprise. " Iron Babe 's turret revolved. " In other words, you 're afraid there 's a spy here. " The word " spy " sent a visible shock through the crowd. Someone headed toward the door and I heard a low voice say, " I just remembered, I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ migration toward the door and it looked like the meeting was over. Marlena had n't pulled it off after all. I had n't expected her to, but in a way I was disappointed. But before the meeting fizzled into nothingness, a small dust-caked rover limped forward to take the area before the stage. I recognized the primitive box-like structure and rumpled brown hat at once. It was Old Charlie, one of the first prospectors at Clavius, a legend who had been scratching the lunar surface before most of us were a gleam in a CAD/CAM data file. The bull sessions at Marlena 's Place were rife with tall tales about just how antiquated Old Charlie was : that he had originally been built to prospect for gold-that his CPU was a Z80 chip-that he had helped Armstrong and Aldrin collect rocks-and had waved when Apollo 8 flew over. If anyone had more influence over lunar prospectors than Laszlo, Marlena, or Iron Babe, it was the Ancient One himself, who had dwelt at the dawn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The One Who Had Started It All, he had at least rubbed shoulders with the guy. The sense of history descended upon us, and the room immediately hushed, and we waited for the reedy, quavering voice that we had all heard so rarely yet knew so well. " About a month ago... " Old Charlie began. Then he paused, and we waited. Finally, he reboarded his train of thought, and started again : " About a month ago... I found a shard from the Clavius Impact Object. I spent a full week chiseling out twelve kilos of near-pure palladium ore, enough for a shell load and then some. Then, two blocks from the space gun-right there at the corner of Aldrin and Main in broad earthlight-somebody flips me and takes my bag. The prints were swept up, but I 'll never forget the shadow behind me! It was... Big Bart! He and his gang left me so beat up, half my solar batteries do n't work no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door had been checked. Marlena 's eyes turned to me, and her camera mounting dipped once, a most satisfied nod indeed. Lenses zoomed as another robot rolled forward. I recognized Chester from the scraggly beard of plastic strips glued to his undercarriage. " Somebody went into my camp, too, " Chester said. " Stole my microscope. Stole my spectrometer. The security cam caught one of Bart 's gang dead to rights, but the UN 's just sitting on it. You all know how much it costs to ship replacement equipment from Earth-and how do I know that wo n't be swiped too? " Rovers retreated from the door and clustered near the stage. And more came forward to speak their piece. Diamond Jim : " Bart 's boys have been pawing over my survey site for months now. " Fuzzy 2 : " Big Bart smashed Fuzzy 1 into a hundred pieces! " Little A1 : " My claim 's registered-but Bart mines it anyhow. " Then the voices ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @! " " Me too! " " We ca n't stand for this any longer! " " If we fight, what have we got to lose? " " So who 's in the posse? " Marlena shouted above the tumult. The crowd abruptly fell still and silent. And then-with a massive wave, all at once-manipulators sprouted, a field of mechanical grass whipping in a stiff breeze of political agitation. They all cheered, including me. And for a moment it looked like Marlena was going to have her revolution after all. Then we felt the floor vibrate. We turned to the front. The wall rattled visibly and dents popped in the door plate like a bad case of pimples. The Sonic Simulation Channel 's pattern-recognition software detected the motion and translated it into the most chilling sound effect I 'd ever heard Clang... clang... CLANG! The whole building shook like it was about to collapse-and then the plate blocking the front door fell inward and slammed into the floor. The immense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, glaring stars eclipsed the sunlight. The silhouette moved toward us. The doorframe caught against the spikes. A claw thrashed and the doorway widened. Big Bart rolled inside and surveyed the scene. " WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ABOUT? " Marlena did n't miss a beat. She rolled to the front of the stage and glared back at Bart. " We 're bringing you to justice, that 's what! " The rovers advanced an inch. The excavator did n't move, and from my position, I had an excellent opportunity to compare relative sizes. Iron Babe was right : Big Bart was just about as large as all the others put together. It was obvious : he had n't been designed for excavation so much as extermination. After that first brave inch, the rovers hesitated. " YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO PEOPLE WHO GET IN MY WAY? " Big Bart reached behind him, through the hole that had been a doorway. He flung a foil-covered object at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clung to the fixture, long enough for us to recognize that it was a rover with chassis mangled, wheels and limbs missing, and lenses cracked. Then I saw the blue star dangling beneath the registry label. It was Sheriff Laszlo. Laszlo slipped off the chandelier and fell in the slow motion of lunar gravity to the floor. " NOW WHO WANTS TO BE NEXT? " Marlena rolled to the end of the stage and took the ramp down to the floor. The rovers cleared a path. She rolled right up to Bart and jabbed a claw at his face. " You do n't scare us, Bart! We- " " MARLENA THE MIDGET! HA HA HA! " Marlena 's manipulator arms drew back for the punch. Bart shadowed her with his claw, and it looked like she was two seconds from becoming metal pizza. But then he had a more ignoble idea. " WHAT THE HELL! I 'LL USE YOU AS SPARE PARTS! " The claw plucked Marlena off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his work was done, backed out onto the street. " THE REST OF YOU... I DO N'T WANT ANY TROUBLE FROM THE REST OF YOU! " With Marlena struggling helplessly and calling him names that had nothing to do with the Old West, Bart rolled out of sight and the sound of his motor died away. The rovers scattered and the saloon emptied. I was alone with what was left of the United Nations enforcement representative 's rover. I looked at all the damage-the entry, the chandelier, the debris, the broken rover-and wondered if this was a warm-up act for Big Bart to raze the whole town. He apparently had overcome his fear of the Clavius Gulch Shopowner 's Association-not to mention the United Nations. Maybe his masters figured that once he brought lunar mining to a halt, their consortium 's stranglehold on terrestrial palladium production would keep political trouble at bay. " Wiley! " The voice creaked and was barely audible, but I heard it and directionalized it from the sheriff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye regarded me. " This is what I get, " Laszlo said, his voice faint and wheezing with static. " After I heard what he did to your partner, I tried to stop Big Bart. I really did. " " I'm-I 'm sorry, " I said. " It 's up to you now. You 've got to stop him, Wiley. " " What can I do? He 's an international corporation and I 'm just one person. If the UN ca n't handle him, how can I? " " Wiley, he destroyed your own partner! " The sheriff attempted to rise on the stump of his right arm. " If I could overcome my fear, you can too! " " I'm-I 'm not afraid. " I lied, and then I thought of a further lie : " Sheriff, look-if there were someone here to help me, if I only knew what to do, I 'd do it! " The rover 's manipulator arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor. The indicator lights died, and so did the law on the Moon. Or so I thought. While I rested alone in the cavernlike saloon, my workstation phone chimed. I routinely redirect my cell phone number into the VR equipment 's phone system, and had done so that night because I was hoping Lester would call. But it was n't Lester. It was Marlena. My searchbeam played across the tombstones on Cemetery Hill : Rusty, Dexter, Ruby, Fuzzy 1, Calamity Jane, Deadeye... and Marlena 1. Opening the gate, I entered the town graveyard of obsolete rovers. I rolled over to the last marker, dragging a shovel behind me. " I 'm there, " I said over the cell phone connection. " Finally! " Marlena sighed. " Start digging! " I did. Then I noticed the epitaph on the tombstone : " ' Here lies Marlena One. She was small-but ware n't she fun? " Ware n't? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " It was n't just for macabre humor that old robots were buried on the Moon. Having them around meant the " corpses " could be exhumed for spare parts. Keeping them buried the rest of the time protected those potential spare parts from the temperature and radiation extremes of the lunar surface. So there was a practical reason for the underground junkyard. But calling it " Cemetery Hill, " erecting tombstones, carving epitaphs-those touches witnessed to Marlena 's whimsy at work once again. While I dug, I shook both my heads, human and robotic. " So the Marlena the Robot that I 've always known and loved was n't the original. " " Nope, " Marlena the Human replied. " She 's actually Marlena Number Two. Marlena Number One was the robot I drove back in my prospecting days before I opened the saloon. A little before your time. " Mercifully short of the traditional " six feet under, " the shovel bit metal. I scraped away the remaining dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of a violin case, and shaped like a coffin. I pried open the lid. Inside lay a tiny rover. It had a single eye and a single claw, and was as gray and lifeless as the Moon. " I can see why you upgraded, " I said. I replaced the old batteries with fresh ones from Marlena 's inventory. " Power 's on. see if you can link. " " Should be able to. I 'm transmitting the old access codes... hey! " Indicator lights flickered on. The rover in the coffin raised a gnarled, bony claw. Skinny and decrepit, it certainly looked like the limb of a zombie. The camera eye swiveled on Wiley. " Well, get me out of here! " she demanded. The other parts looked badly worn, but her tongue was as sharp as ever. I pulled her out of the grave, dented antenna and all, and we rolled off Cemetery Hill to the saloon. Entering through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence over the remains of her enterprise. Then we rolled to the back room, and she entered a closet. I stopped at the threshold and waited. A moment later, she returned, towing a cord. The cord drew a wagon. On the wagon was a cannon. " You 've got to be kidding! " I said. Yes, a miniature cannon, like the ones people mount on yachts to fire blank charges, usually after they 've had a few drinks-except this ornament was dull iron instead of polished brass, and Marlena was cold sober. " Bob the Blacksmith forged it for me, " Marlena said to my inquiring stare. " Has it been tested? " " Of course. It 's punched through quarter-inch steel plate! " " How thick is Big Bart 's armor? " She patted the barrel. " We 'll find out. " " And you want me to fire this thing at him? " " I was n't expecting you to be the hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I appreciate your help. " Our two dumb machines just stared at each other. Finally, I realized I was an unwanted guest, and went out the front way. A few feet outside the saloon, I looked southwest and saw the space gun, pointing toward me like a giant, accusing finger. I turned and looked northeast, and saw the Earth, framed by the building fronts bordering Main Street. Seen from Clavius, the Earth appears to hover in a fixed position, seemingly swollen by its proximity to the horizon, the same optical illusion that makes the newly risen Moon seem huge over the horizons of Earth. But all one has to do is extend one 's claw and compare it to the globe, and the Earth seems small once more. I thought about Wendell 's vision of spreading life throughout the universe. If the Earth is one life-bearing planet among millions, then fine, we can afford to stay home and contemplate our navels. But it 's scientifically legitimate to postulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transported life across Solar-System distances to Mars, but that would be about it. As far as the stars are concerned, the evidence-or lack thereof-seems to point toward life-lessness. I still think it 's a stretch to conclude that humanity 's fate-and the fate of all life in the universe-depends on the economic viability of lunar mining. But what if it was true? It was a terrible burden that Marlena was bearing on her shoulders, all by herself, especially with that rickety old robot as her only avatar. What did she mean, I was n't expecting you to be the hero? I decided I was going to talk to her about that. Mind you, I was n't going to volunteer for anything-I was just going to challenge her temerity about that hero business. Where did she get off, saying what I could and could n't be? I returned to the saloon. In the darkness, a bright spot caught the corner of my eye. I swiveled my camera mounting and saw the shelves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sold as part of her Old West fantasy. It was a white one that I 'd seen. White : the clich about " the good guys always wear white hats " came to mind. I shook my head. IfI could help it, I would avoid Western visual clichs just as much as verbal ones. I looked over the selection, and laid my claws on a dark brown number. I picked it up. I lowered it on my camera mounting. I rolled over to the mirror. Not exactly Glint Eastwood, but-I tilted it forward a rakish skosh. There. Now that was Glint Eastwood. " You 're still here? " She had caught me totally by surprise. I turned around and pulled off the hat. " I left and came back, " I replied. " The hat looks good on you. " She did n't see me purse my lips. " You know, " I said, " you have no business telling me I ca n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a hero, but you have no business telling me that I ca n't be one. " " Okay.... " " And I thought I could give you some advice. No help-I want to make that absolutely clear-just advice. " " Okay.... " " For one thing, that gun is n't going to work. Not by itself. If you 're going to defeat Big Bart, you 'll have to do better than a pop gun. " " Okay.... " Well, as you can see, she was just playing out the line... before she reeled me in. " Are you sure you want to do this? " Marlena asked about half an hour later. " You know, if you lose Wiley, you could get in trouble with your company-not to mention what kind of trouble you 'll be in with BPC. " Typical female, I thought. Talks you into something, then tries to make it sound like it was your idea! " Do n't give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said. " I already have enough of those. " Marlena was not in sight, and not in the Sonic Simulation Channel 's conversational range. We kept in contact over the phone connection. I had left her near the saloon and had taken off down the street, a cowboy hat on my camera mounting and her wagon and cannon in tow, on a search-and-destroy mission for Big Bart. Every cross street and alley I passed, I held my breath, but the giant claw never reached out and grabbed me. Looming shadows did not appear, and every corner proved without surprise. Then-voices ahead. I pulled the wagon into an alley, dropped the tow cord, and rolled ahead on my own. At the corner, I cautiously peered down the street. It was Big Bart and his gang-seven robots in all, most of them my size or bigger. They swaggered down the street, whooping and yelling, carefree as could be. They halted and Bart set a bag down, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A rover approached with a very large screwdriver, and the others made ribald comments. I got the symbolism and did n't like it one bit. " Big Bart! " I shouted, rolling into the open so that he could see my hat. Bart and his cohorts turned. The rover with the screwdriver lowered it. " What in tarnation? " I shouted. " It 's the biggest varmint I 've ever seen! " The robots looked to their leader, but he was just standing still. " Yep, Big Bart, " I said. " Ah reckon you ai n't nothin " but a slimy ol " rattlesnake! " He swung toward me and lunged a foot-but halted. He waved a claw and chuckled. " GET LOST, PIPSQUEAK! " The rover holding the screwdriver raised it again, and the rest gathered around Marlena 's prone body again, and the laughter resumed. So I went to Plan B. Out of my carrying compartment, I drew Lester 's gun. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this was it-I was about to incur the wrath of one of the biggest corporations on Planet Earth, and there would be no turning back. But then, there had been no turning back from the moment their spy had snuck into our lab tent. What happened now was simply inevitable fallout. Their backsides were studiously turned toward me, but my spirit of fair play was at an all-time low. I took aim at the character with the screwdriver, pulled the trigger and made a little crater in the street next to his left rear wheel. The others still laughed and joked about Marlena-but he noticed. His camera mounting turned. I compensated my aim a tweak-and then I made a little crater in him. Sparks spat from the puncture in the rover 's side. He jerked to a halt, his lights extinguished, his manipulator arms went limp, and the screwdriver tumbled out of his claws. The laughter and jokes died. The gang turned around as a unit. Wasting no time, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gang was gone. The survivors scurried behind their boss-who glared straight at me. 1 emptied the pistol, but it was useless against him. I tossed it away and scrammed back towards the alley. The dark crab 's " third eye " opened, and out came the barrel. I passed around the corner before it fired. The shell blew through the building walls, inches from where I 'd been. I passed Marlena 's wagon twenty feet from the alley mouth. I got behind the cannon and looked back. In the gap between shattered walls, Bart 's headlamps gleamed upon the street dust. The ground trembled beneath my wheels. I raised one claw to the cannon 's firing switch, and the hardest part was waiting. Bart turned the corner. I pressed the switch. The cannon flashed and recoiled. A tracer ball streaked toward where Bart 's heart would be, if he had one. It was a direct hit. The ball bounced off, leaving only a small dent. Bart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he and his entourage charged. I abandoned the cannon just as a retaliatory shell blasted it to bits. The remains of the cannon and wagon must have slowed Bart down while he crunched them under his tank tracks, but I did n't look back. I swerved around the next corner, raced down the street, and swung into another alley. " Marlena! " I called. Our terrestrial phone link was clear as a bell, but still I shouted breathlessly. " They 're chasing me! Get ready! " " I 'm ready! " she shouted back. Headlamps flashed my long shadow in front of me. I broke out of the alley and rolled down Gold Street. I zigged and zagged, and Bart 's shells missed, his aim crippled by the three-second Einsteinian delay in Newton 's Third Law. An intersection came up. I veered right. " I 'm on Armstrong Avenue! " " Is he behind you? " He was n't. I might have lost him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flash, Bart and his gang swung past the corner, and bore down. I spun my wheels and hurled toward the next intersection. " Coming up on Main! " A shell splattered Wiley 's hide with dust. " Get ready! " Heading southeast, I crossed Main and looked on my left at the saloon. Farther down, Marlena waved a bandanna. The distraction was almost fatal. A shell hit near my wheels. A rotor status bar flashed red and an rpm reading dropped to zero. I steered right to compensate. I sprinted past Main, hid behind an alley corner, and peered out. Bart and his gang were crossing the intersection. This is it, I thought. But nothing happened. He passed the intersection unharmed, and I retracted into the alley just in time to dodge another shell. " Marlena! You were supposed to shoot! " " I would have missed! " she cried. " It 's the time delay! " " What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to lead the target! " " Well, how the hell am I supposed to do that, Brian? " she snapped. " By the time I see him clear the buildings on the right, he 's already through the intersection and behind the buildings on the left. How do I lead a target I ca n't even see until it 's too late? " The best laid plans of mice and microrovers. The plan made sense in the saloon half an hour ago. With the enemy engaged, it unraveled with the speed of light. " Brian, " she said. " The only way we can do this is if you bring him back to Main-and keep him there! " " I can bring him back to Main-but how am I supposed to keep him there? " She did n't answer, but I did n't have to ask. I knew what she was thinking. I 'd been the lure this far, and now I 'd have to hop inside the fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmured. " Nice knowing you-hope they do n't take you out of my severance pay! " I ducked up Tsiolkovsky Street, heading northeast. Bart 's lights outlined my shadow. My spine chilled. He was less than thirty yards behind, and closing. My shadow shortened. I felt his breath. I weaved between his shells. A rover pulled alongside Wiley and bumped him. A blur streaked overhead and disintegrated a wall. I reached Aldrin Avenue. I turned right. " On Aldrin! " I shouted. " Heading toward Main! " It was not a good time for my low-charge indicator to blink. I reached the intersection of Aldrin and Main. I stopped. The assailant rover flew past. I turned northeast, toward Earth, and rolled a few yards, and stopped again. I waited. Big Bart stampeded into the intersection. He saw me and skidded to a stop. The leviathan turned toward me. " Get him to move a little to the west! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over my rover. I backed up, rolled around the newly dug crater, and moved west. Bart fired again, and missed. He gave up shooting then, raised his claws and closed in. I backed up-but then bumped into something. Bart 's accomplices formed a semicircle, hemming me in. One rover clamped a claw on my antenna, and another grabbed my towing ring, and I could n't break free. Big Bart loomed over Wiley 's struggling body, and raised his claw, poised to piledrive. Marlena, he 's in position! I thought Go ahead and do it! " POOR OLD WILEY, " Big Bart boomed. " YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE I RESPECTED, BECAUSE YOU DID N'T GO ALONG WITH ALL THAT COWBOY CRAP. BUT NOW SHE 'S GOT YOU WEARlNG A HAT, TOO. " " Yep, " I said. My brain had frozen and I did n't know what else to say. Marlena-do it! " THAT WAS CLEVER, THE WAY YOU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CANNON. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU NEEDED A BIGGER GUN. " " Yep, " I said. Marlena! Do it! Do it! Do it! " TROUBLE IS, THERE IS N'T A GUN BIG ENOUGH TO SCARE ME ANYWHERE ON- " Big Bart hesitated, and looked at the Earth-and I think he figured it out. A second and a half too late. " Yep, " I said. Marlena-SHOOT, damn it! And she did. The ten-kilo shell that Marlena fired from the space gun exited the muzzle at two and a half kilometers per second and streaked a meter above Main Street to impact Big Bart milliseconds later with enough kinetic energy to sink a battleship. It ripped through his backside armor and gutted his innards and punched a hole as big as his face-that obliterated his face-and spewed his components over Wiley 's head and a tenth of a mile down Main, across Collins and Conrad Avenues and halfway to the Calibration Target Monolith. Bart 's claws snapped off, his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and debris and smoke gushered everywhere. The noise-oh, the SSC-generated noise! It was like a tornado and volcanic eruption at the same time, and somewhere in there I thought I heard an all-too-human scream. Instinctively, after the fact, I closed my eyes and ducked. And then there was ringing silence. I opened my eyes and raised my head. Gasses dissipated and sparks died, and what remained of Big Bart was a charred, lifeless hulk. The three survivors of Big Bart 's gang sized me up. But before they could act, a door on a nearby building opened, and a pair of lenses peeped out. Then another door, and other eyes. A rover rolled out onto the street, and it was joined by a second and third. Soon there was a crowd. They all seemed to be carrying cords and blunt instruments. When I turned around, Big Bart 's cohorts were in rapid evaporation. A small, dusty rover hobbled from the space gun control station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took in the piles of incandescently glowing scrap metal littering the street. " Wow, " she said. " You took your time, " I said. " I wanted my aim to be perfect. " I glanced at the shattered carcass that used to contain Big Bart, and said the only thing that came to mind : " Yep. " The lights abruptly faded from Marlena 1 ; the excitement had proven too much for the old girl, and she passed away, right then and there. But a minute later, Doc strolled around the corner, escorting a polished silver robot adorned with sparkling jewels and a billowing lace headdress that flopped vigorously with every swaying movement. Marlena 2-the Marlena I had always known-tackled Wiley and squeezed him with her claws and half-lifted him off the ground and almost gave him a dance-hall twirl. " I 've got something for you! " she declared. She rolled back a foot and opened a compartment on her side. Out came a shiny piece of metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star. It must have had a powerful magnet attached to the back, because when she placed it on Wiley 's front, it stuck tenaciously. " Brian, I want you to know, " Marlena said, " you 're my candidate for sheriff of Clavius Gulch. If your company wo n't let you keep Wiley, we 'll get you another rover so you can stay here. You 're going to be voted sheriff, Brian-even if I have to bribe every rover in town with free lubes for a year! " " I-I have to think, " I said, tilting my Clint-Eastwood hat back and regarding the crowd of curious telerobots gathered around us. But part of me was already thinking I 'd take the job. The events of the past day had sure been a lot more exciting than drilling for regolith samples. And Lester would n't mind serving as deputy. And who knew? Maybe the job of sheriff of Clavius Gulch came with a salary that could cover the rent and phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't ready to commit just then. I disconnected myself from her embrace and rolled away. My thoughts were a blur. I was still rattled by the chase and showdown, and the explosive end of Big Bart still rang in my ears. Just then, I did n't know where I was going, I just wanted to go away and think in peace. But at the top of Cemetery Hill, I stopped and looked back at the town, aglow in the dying rays of the long lunar day. Marlena and the other rovers were still in the middle of Main Street, devotedly watching me. I had the strangest feeling. I turned the other way again, and blinked in the afternoon Sun, which was almost touching the lunar horizon directly ahead. And then I realized what was bugging me about the scene. " Oh, Lord, " I sighed. I closed my eyes and shook my head-and groaned. It was n't because I was pondering humanity 's future. It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I groaned because, unintentionally, I was acting out the biggest clich of the Old West. I groaned because, by happenstance, I was heading west. Which meant that, from the view of the townspeople of Clavius Gulch... Sheriff Wiley was riding off into the sunset.
