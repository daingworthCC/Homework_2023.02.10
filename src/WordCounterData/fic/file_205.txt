4121841 Members of the Juilliard and Grammywinntng Parker quartets share their insights <p> MUCH LIKE ANY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP, the intimacy of a chamber ensemble requires open lines of communication. The added complexity is, however, being able to understand, give, and heed attenuated and nonverbal cues while performing. Invariably, any group wil! develop a system for communicating with cues. " Most often it is the first violin that is responsible for this, although there are many moments when the music demands that one or more of the other players take that responsibility, " Juilliard String Quartet violisi Samuel Rhodes says. " There are more subtle ways of signaling than outright cueing. <p> " By looking at a colleague 's body language as he or she is playing, you should be able to tell how to exactly coordinate your part with him. Sometimes a group of phrases can be planned with a number of alternatives in dynamics and/or pacing. You can tell by how a colleague begins that particular series of phrases which of the alternatives would be chosen at that moment. If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second time in a different way, leading to a variant of the original plan. <p> " This is especially useful in a minuet or scherzo in which there are several repeats of the same material. " <p> Positioning can also be used strategically. " One thing a first violinist can do perhaps more freely than the others in the quartet is to direct his or her sound in different directions, " Juiliard violinist Joseph Lin says. <p> Among the various possibilities, two are more obvious : you can turn inward and play into the group, or you can turn slightly out and play toward the audience.

" Playing into the group may signal a more concerted effort to create a unified sound. Or it could be the first violinist saying that this is a musical dialogue - ' listen to the way I play rny line and I will listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a first violinist turns outward and plays to the audience, it often means that he or she wants more profile for the first violin line. At the same time, it also allows the other players to take a greater role in carrying the music forward without active leading from the first violinist. " <p> Cues are essential in helping to keep an ensemble together during performance, but catching them can sometimes be difficult. A nod or a shoulder raise - sometimes simply breathing is a cue. " Shaping notes, vibrato, a shift of posture are all cues, " violinist Karen Kirn of the Grammy Award-winning Parker Quartet says. <p> As you grow and develop as an ensemble, your innate sense of other players ' cues deepens. For many pros, this becomes second nature. " A good deal of the coordination of ensemble relies on what 1 call ' radar/ the almost unconscious awareness of one 's colleagues ' feelings of pulse, " Juilliard violinist Ronald Copes says. " There are a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a players ' changing bow speed or the noticing of an evolving ' heat ' in the sound of a particular line.
