4023141( and Us, Your Plain, Boring Fifth-Graders) Will the new girl come between Amelia and Katy? Or will they learn the secret of friendship? // Have you seen her yet? " That 's the first thing I ask Katy as we 're trudging toward school on Friday. There was a blizzard yesterday, so we had a snow day. Katy trekked to my house and we attempted to build an igloo. Then we made mugs of hot chocolate with a million minimarshmallows. " Seen who? " Katy asks. " I did n't tell you? " I stop in my tracks. " I seriously did n't tell you? " " Amelia, " Katy groans, rolling her eyes. " Stop being a drama queen. " I jump up and down on the icy sidewalk. " I 'm SO not being a drama queen! " Katy giggles. Of course I 'm being a drama queen. Katy and I have been best friends since kindergarten. We 're midway through fifth grade, so she knows me well by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, loud most of the time. Katy is Korean-American and a violinist. She 's a straight-A student, but teachers are always telling her to speak up. " The new girl, " I say. " My mom rented her family their house. Her name is Stella and she starts today. " " So there 's a new kid, " Katy says. " What 's so great about that? " " First of all, she 's from New York City- " " Eight million people live in New York City, " Katy says, shifting her violin strap on her shoulder. " Thanks, Miss Census, but will you let me finish? I never get a word in around you! " Katy makes a face like I 've insulted her, but I can tell she 's trying to keep from laughing. " What I was trying to say is that Stella is... " I clear my throat. " She 's famous, Katy. " " Famous? " Katy asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big singer. Her parents told my mom that she 's sung on children 's albums. She 's even been in commercials. " " What 's she doing here? " Katy gestures at our tiny town in the Adirondacks. " My mom said her parents are painters, " I say. " They came to the mountains for inspiration. " " What commercials has she been in? " " That, " I say, linking arms with Katy as we push through the doors of school, " is what we 'll learn when we become friends with her. " I am the luckiest girl in the Adirondacks! Stella winds up in Mr. Maloney 's class-the same class as Katy and me. We 're sitting at our desks, waiting for the day to begin, when this girl walks in. She 's got light-brown hair that has a cotton-candy streak of pink down the front. She 's wearing a purple skirt with black and white striped tights and bracelets up both arms. As she walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. " Is that her? " " Yep, " I say, beaming. She fits my mom 's description perfectly. " Are you sure she 's our age? " Katy whispers as Mr. Maloney directs Stella to an empty desk. " That 's what my mom said. Besides, if she were older she 'd be at Butler Middle. " I watch as Stella slides on lip gloss. I have images of Katy and me hanging out with her. She 'll show us how to put streaks in our hair. Maybe she 'll give us singing lessons. By the time we get to middle school, we 'll have some serious status. We definitely need that to survive sixth grade. I open my notebook and begin sketching a flower. As I 'm doodling, I try to figure out how to become friends with Stella. Maybe I 'll mention that my mom rented her their house. Or maybe " Katy? " Mr. Maloney says. " Can you come here please? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I watch as Mr. Maloney says something to Katy. She nods, and then he says, " Stella? " As Stella approaches his desk, she smiles and says hi to Katy. They both laugh and leave the room. My pulse is racing. I ca n't believe Mr. Maloney has chosen Katy, of all people, to show Stella around the school. Maybe he picked her because she 's musical like Stella. Mr. Maloney is always telling Katy and me that we need to branch out. So now he 's matching Katy up with Stella, and they 're going to hit it off. And guess who 'll be left alone to dodge spitballs at Butler Middle next year? I am the most miserable girl in the Adirondacks. As Mr. Maloney drones on about book reports, I watch the clock. Katy and Stella have been gone for 45 minutes. I bet they 're skipping down the halls, laughing their heads off. At 10 o'clock, when we go to art class, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tear my tissue paper into angry little shreds. A few minutes later, the door opens. Katy approaches my table, but I stare down at my collage. I can see out of the corner of my eye that Stella is with her. I 'm so not looking up. " Hey, you, " Katy says. " Oh, " I say like I had n't realized she was there. " I have to go to orchestra. Can Stella sit with you? " I shrug. " Sure. " Katy turns to Stella. " This is my best friend, Amelia. The one I was telling you about. " As Stella slides into my table, Katy walks out. I know I should feel better, but I 'm still on edge. I want Stella to be my friend, to be this new person who makes my life amazing. I wish I could snap my fingers, and we could bypass the getting-to-know-you stuff and be comfortable around each other. Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, I have no idea what to say. I bet it was n't this way for Katy. She 's quieter than me, but she always has interesting things to talk about. After a few painfully silent minutes, Stella says, " Want to hear something depressing? My birthday 's tomorrow and my parents just moved me away from all my friends. " All of a sudden, it clicks. If I want Stella to be my friend, I have to start somewhere. " Maybe you could come to my house, " I say. " Really? " Stella asks. And then, typical me, I zoom from zero to 60 in 2 seconds. " I 'll bake you cupcakes! " When Stella does n't respond, I add, " I 'll invite Katy, too. " When Stella still does n't respond, I say, " Come over at 6 o'clock. " Then I grab a marker and scribble down my address and phone number. On Saturday evening, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll give us a chance to frost the cupcakes. As Katy kicks the slush off her boots, I say, " What did you get for her? " " A picture frame, " she says. " I painted it last night. " " Why 'd you have to do that? " I ask. " I just bought her a bracelet. Now she 's going to think I 'm boring. " " Hi to you too, " Katy says, making a face at me. But this time she actually looks mad. I lead Katy into the kitchen. I 've taped up streamers and balloons. I even put on some of my mom 's lip gloss. As Katy and I are frosting the cupcakes, the phone rings. " Amelia! " my mom calls from upstairs. " It 's for you. " I lick some chocolate frosting off my fingers and grab the phone. " Hello? " " Hey, it 's Stella. " I glance at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes. " What 's up? " I ask. " My big sister just drove in from Boston to surprise me, " Stella says. " My parents did n't even know she was coming. She has to leave first thing in the morning. " I can sense right away where this is heading. I feel Katy watching me, so I turn toward the wall. " I 'm so sorry, Amelia, " Stella says. " I never get to see my sister anymore. Can we maybe hang out another weekend? " " OK, " I say quietly. I feel a lump forming in my throat. " Thanks for understanding, " Stella says. " See you in school on Monday. " " See you in school, " I whisper. After we hang up, I stand there, my hand still on the phone. " What was that about? " Katy asks. All of a sudden, I start sniffling. " Did Stella just bail on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That is not nice! " Katy yells. I turn around and stare at Katy. She 's never talked so loudly in her entire life. Katy goes on about how you ca n't cancel at the last minute unless you 're deathly sick or snowed in, and even in the case of a blizzard, that 's what boots are for. At some point during her rant, I tap her arm. " What? " she asks in this booming voice. I wipe my eyes and explain about Stella 's sister and how she never gets to see her and how, even though I feel bad, it 's nice she got a visitor, especially since she just moved away from all her friends. " I did n't know she had a sister, " Katy says. " Me neither. " I pause. " Come to think of it, I do n't know anything about her. " " Other than she 's famous and you want to be her new best friend, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I shriek. Then I exhale deeply, massage my temples, and say, " I 'm sorry for what I said about the picture frame. That was n't nice, either. " Katy nods. " I know you think we 're plain and boring. But we have fun, right? " " Yeah. But are n't you worried about middle school? " " Whatever happens, we have our friendship. " Katy pauses for a moment. " We have to promise we wo n't ditch each other if something better comes along. Maybe we 'll become friends with Stella. But no matter what, you and I come first. " " Definitely, " I say. Then I stick my fingers in the edges of my mouth and go cross-eyed. Katy stares at me. " May I ask what you 're doing? " " I 'm just wondering... " I waggle my tongue from side to side, " whether the party can still go on? " " Definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cupcake, tap them together, and take a bite. Write to Win!

The two girls are excited because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is especially eager to befriend Stella because Stella is from New York and has been on TV. But things do n't work out like Amelia hopes they will. First, Katy, instead of her, is picked to show Stella around the school. Then, in art class, Amelia feels shy when she has to talk to Stella alone. But, she soon comes up with a plan to get Stella to like her : She invites Stella over to her house for a birthday party. Unfortunately, when the day finally arrives, Stella cancels. At first, Amelia and Katy feel this way about their change in plans : angry and disappointed. But as time passes, they realize that Stella was n't doing it to be mean. Plus, they learn a valuable lesson about friendship : old friends are just as important as new ones.
