Let 's go. <p> Narrator 1 : The older boys laugh as they get into their car.

W-Why did you tell Chris I spit on his car? <p> Mark : I-I was trying to trick him. As soon as he grabbed you, I was going to jump him. But-but the other kid, the real big one, Shawn, grabbed me. <p> Alex : H-He did? I did n't see <p> Mark : Yeah. He had me in a choke hold. He almost killed me. <p> Narrator 1 : Alex stands up slowly and picks up his books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark : I 'm going to get those guys.
