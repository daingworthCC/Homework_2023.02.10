4076041 Last year of high school. I 'm with a girlfriend in a grungy diner in the West End of Toronto. Through the windows, flurries sprinkle from the sky onto the traffic, signalling the descent winter. Despite the weather, we 've been nursing an ice cream float. Mel has a definite boyish air - a welcome change from the stuck-up girls at school caked in their layers of make-up and hair products, who constantly obsess about the size of boys ' dicks. She does n't make me feel like a deranged gender anomaly - or at least, the only deranged gender anomaly. I look over the table at her. She seems bored. I 've tried connecting with her ; she 's in my writing class, and we seem to share a love of writing and music. But she always feels cold and distant towards me. Sometimes I wonder why she even hangs around me. I think she 's hiding something. Suddenly, I decide to come out to her. " I have to tell you something, " I say. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like a lesbian trapped in a boy 's body, " I tell her. " Hmm... " she muses, processing what I said. " Interesting you should say that, " she says. " Sometimes I feel like a gay boy trapped in a girl 's body. " " Hmm... " I reply. We pause silently with our dilemmas, and drift back to nursing our float. First year of university. The table I 'm sitting on gives that feel of a patient 's room in a doctor 's office : cold, sterile and professionally clean. But instead of medical posters showing crosssectioned layers of human anatomy, the walls feature the works of various contemporary pop-cultural artists, arranged neatly to calm the viewer-who is about to become a live canvas. My piercer walks in. He 's a heavyset man who sports a goatee and, unsurprisingly, many piercings and tattoos. He seems calm, composed, and has a non-judgmental air about him-a very comforting first impression. " Hi, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he 's already wearing his medical gloves. Even though he 's detached and professional, he still feels warm and comforting ; he knows his boundaries. " Nice to meet ya, " I reply, batting my lashes and smiling. " So where would you like your piercing done? " he asks, as he gently marks several points on my face. He gives me a mirror. I look into the mirror and choose the one I want. " That one, " I say. " Great, " he says calmly, already focusing on the technicalities of his next work of art. I hand him the jewellery I chose earlier. He takes a fresh needle out of its sterile package and pulls up my upper lip. " Here we go... " he says, approaching carefully. I feel a small poke-it must be just the initial pierce. " All done! " " That 's it? " " Yup. " He hands me the mirror. I 'm not quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hmm... " I say, contemplating. " There was n't much pain. " " You 're a natural, " he says. " And it looks cute on you. " " Thank you! " I say, smiling. Then the blood rushes to my head and I have a quiet cathartic moment : I 've found a queer-positive space in a neighbourhood where people 's body language usually reeks of condescending heterosexism. " The girl at the front will give you after-care instructions, " he says. " Enjoy! " " Thank you! " I say again graciously. " Oh, " I remember, " Happy Valentines ' Day! " " Happy Valentines ' Day to you too, honey, " he says, smiling. I came here lost, confused, and alone on Valentine 's Day. I now leave with a stronger sense of who I am, with the closet shut tightly behind me, marked by my new piercing. Happy Valentine 's Day to me, and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's my Stockwell Day crush again. I do n't know his real name. I just call him that because he shares a number of striking features with the former Alliance Party leader : chiselled cheekbones, a sharp haircut and a calm, professional air. He 's a stunning example of a Caucasian man. I 've never actually spoken to him. I think he might live somewhere uptown, and I 've seen him walking around in the mid-town yuppie village. All he does is whistle at me when he spots me around the city, and each time I giggle like a schoolgirl and run away. I 'm a very mature individual, indeed. What does he see in me? Is he just another tranny-chaser? Does he have an exotic Asian fetish? Or is he just another misguided man looking for love with the wrong person? Even more perplexing, why am I so attracted to him? Is it because he 's a classic male archetype and he stands in contrast to my gender? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - the kind of desire that whisks loneliness away. Who knows? All I know is that casual flirtations like these wo n't last very long. He just whistled at me again while I was walking through the pedestrian lanes between cafs in the yuppie neighbourhood. I looked into his eyes again, but the game was already over-done - I had gotten bored of him. In my unresponsive gaze, he saw our precious, fleeting relationship crumble. Bedroom death - and we did n't even get to the bedroom. Third year of university : fashion trade show at the convention centre. Girls are everywhere. I 'm with my friend Kaley. As we walk down one of the aisles, a girl approaches us dressed in a suit jacket and skirt cut precisely to fit her tall, skinny dimensions. She has matching cut bangs, neatly drawn eyeliner, and just the right amount of foundation. She holds a clipboard sporting her agency 's brand logo. " Hi! " she says, pinning us with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @. Have you ever worked for a modeling agency before? " I shake my head. " I have, but it was a long time ago, " Kaley says. " Well, if you 're interested, you can check us out at our booth, " the girl says. She gives us her business card. " Sketchy! " Kaley says. " They just want your money. " I look at the business card. I fall back onto my bed. The morning 's interview had been gruelling. The soulless agent had asked me lots of intimidating questions : attacks on my personality, tests of my attitude, and assessments of how I handle my image. She said I could make a lot of money as a model-more money than I 'd ever made. She looked at my photos and said she 'd contact me later in the day. I left her office feeling good, not because I felt any warmth from her, but because I was able to match her cold, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wait for her call. I see an old European stone road ; very steep, very tiring. The road never ends And neither do the designer stores that line it. I walk inside them, And never find what I 'm looking for. My eyes shoot wide open as I wake up abruptly, shaken by the dream. I feel sick to my stomach. I try to sit up, but my body wo n't lift. I feel the tear I ripped inside me between my body and my soul. I cry and press my face into my pillow. Is this the kind of pretty you want to be? Is this the kind of girl you want to be? Is this how you want to empower yourself to live out your gender? The modeling agency doesn ' t care whether you ' re a boy or a girl - they just care if you make them money! My cell phone interrupts me during my self-image crisis. I do n't want to answer - I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @, pull myself together, and reach for the phone. She says the agency wants me to sign on. She sounds spirited for the first time. I give her a half-assed excuse about conflicting schedules and how I could n't commit to modeling. Her tone reverts back to her empty professionalism and she thanks me for my interest. I let out a huge sigh, and look at the ceiling. Now how am I going to make money? Still shaken, I slow my breathing to a regular pace. I grab a tissue, clear my sinuses, and wipe my tears. I close my eyes again. I do n't want to be a pretty white girl anymore. Summer of fourth year of university : Dyke March. I 'm exhausted from walking around downtown Toronto all day. The silicone boobs I borrowed from my trans girlfriend are driving me crazy - they fit oddly and they definitely do n't feel natural against my body. But I had fun anyway! I wait for the streetcar on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parked a couple blocks away from the Village in a garage, away from the blaring stages, commercial booths and herds of people..... The sun is beginning to set, but nightfall is still some time away. A middle-aged man crosses the street and walks toward me. " Hey baby, wan na have a drink with me? " he asks up close, entering my personal space. " No, thank you, " I say, forcing a smile. I walk a few paces away, closer to some girls nearby. The man disappears. He suddenly reappears again behind me and wraps his arms around my shoulders. I freeze, paralyzed in fear. " C'm on, I know you want it, " he says in my ear, massaging my chest. At first, my body does n't mind his touch, almost submits to it. But everything else - my mind, my spirit, my emotions - screams at once, terrified at what this strange man is doing. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says, and grabs my crotch. That 's it. I yank his wrist away from my body. " No, I 'm not interested! " I say loudly. " Okay, " he says. He walks away and disappears into the crowd. I let out a huge sigh of relief. The streetcar approaches. I look at the girls standing a few feet away from methey do n't even acknowledge my presence. I show my pass, ride the streetcar, and make my way to the parking garage. I open the passenger seat of my car and sit in the back. The garage is empty, except for rows of quiet cars. I take off my boobs and put them back in their box. I lie in the back seat, curl into the foetal position, and weep. This is not a day to be proud. High above, standing on a snowy mountain with my snowboard, I 've left behind the leering eyes, the cutting eyes, the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind my back, the whispers of faggot under passing people 's breaths, and the frustration I direct at myself for letting them get to me. My Pacific Island roots are with the palm trees, chinelas, and mangos, but I sprang up and flourished here, on soils thousands of miles away, in a place of cedars, flannel, and pine cones. I remember a language without gender binaries, but I can not speak it. I feel the sun on my brown tropical skin. It energizes my body as it shines down on the seemingly endless range of mountains. I stand in awe of what the Earth has to offer, and am reminded of how infinitesimally small I am in this huge swirling universe. I plop my board onto the snow and strap my feet in. I smooth my hair and coat and feel the sun 's warmth flow through my body. I look down the mountain to where I have to go, and prepare my spirit for everything that the world lays @ @
